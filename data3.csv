"1","Orthoptera-TElib: a library of Orthoptera transposable elements for TE annotation","Xuanzeng Liu, Lina Zhao, Muhammad Majid and Yuan Huang","Transposable elements (TEs) are a major component of eukaryotic genomes and are present in almost all eukaryotic organisms. TEs are highly dynamic between and within species, which significantly affects the general applicability of the TE databases. Orthoptera is the only known group in the class Insecta with a significantly enlarged genome (0.93-21.48 Gb). When analyzing the large genome using the existing TE public database, the efficiency of TE annotation is not satisfactory. To address this limitation, it becomes imperative to continually update the available TE resource library and the need for an Orthoptera-specific library as more insect genomes are publicly available. Here, we used the complete genome data of 12 Orthoptera species to de novo annotate TEs, then manually re-annotate the unclassified TEs to construct a non-redundant Orthoptera-specific TE library: Orthoptera-TElib. Orthoptera-TElib contains 24,021 TE entries including the re-annotated results of 13,964 unknown TEs. The naming of TE entries in Orthoptera-TElib adopts the same naming as RepeatMasker and Dfam and is encoded as the three-level form of “level1/level2-level3”. Orthoptera-TElib can be directly used as an input reference database and is compatible with mainstream repetitive sequence analysis software such as RepeatMasker and dnaPipeTE. When analyzing TEs of Orthoptera species, Orthoptera-TElib performs better TE annotation as compared to Dfam and Repbase regardless of using low-coverage sequencing or genome assembly data. The most improved TE annotation result is Angaracris rhodopa, which has increased from 7.89% of the genome to 53.28%. Finally, Orthoptera-TElib is stored in Sqlite3 for the convenience of data updates and user access.","15 March 2024","Transposable elements,Orthoptera genome,TE database,Dfam and repbase,De novo annotation","yuanh@snnu.edu.cn","Yuan Huang."
"2","The role of Smarcad1 in retroviral repression in mouse embryonic stem cells","Igor Bren, Ayellet Tal, Carmit Strauss and Sharon Schlesinger","Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) replication is suppressed in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) by the Trim28-SETDB1 complex. The chromatin remodeler Smarcad1 interacts with Trim28 and was suggested to allow the deposition of the histone variant H3.3. However, the role of Trim28, H3.3, and Smarcad1 in MLV repression in ESCs still needs to be fully understood.,In this study, we used MLV to explore the role of Smarcad1 in retroviral silencing in ESCs. We show that Smarcad1 is immediately recruited to the MLV provirus. Based on the repression dynamics of a GFP-reporter MLV, our findings suggest that Smarcad1 plays a critical role in the establishment and maintenance of MLV repression, as well as other Trim28-targeted genomic loci. Furthermore, Smarcad1 is important for stabilizing and strengthening Trim28 binding to the provirus over time, and its presence around the provirus is needed for proper deposition of H3.3 on the provirus. Surprisingly, the combined depletion of Smarcad1 and Trim28 results in enhanced MLV derepression, suggesting that these two proteins may also function independently to maintain repressive chromatin states.,Overall, the results of this study provide evidence for the crucial role of Smarcad1 in the silencing of retroviral elements in embryonic stem cells. Further research is needed to fully understand how Smarcad1 and Trim28 cooperate and their implications for gene expression and genomic stability.","11 March 2024","H3.3,Smarcad1,Trim28,Retrovirus,Embryonic stem cells,Epigenetic silencing","sharon.shle@mail.huji.ac.il","Sharon Schlesinger."
"3","CRISPR-TE: a web-based tool to generate single guide RNAs targeting transposable elements","Yixin Guo, Ziwei Xue, Meiting Gong, Siqian Jin, Xindi Wu and Wanlu Liu","The CRISPR/Cas systems have emerged as powerful tools in genome engineering. Recent studies highlighting the crucial role of transposable elements (TEs) have stimulated research interest in manipulating these elements to understand their functions. However, designing single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) that are specific and efficient for TE manipulation is a significant challenge, given their sequence repetitiveness and high copy numbers. While various sgRNA design tools have been developed for gene editing, an optimized sgRNA designer for TE manipulation has yet to be established.,We present CRISPR-TE, a web-based application featuring an accessible graphical user interface, available at https://www.crisprte.cn/, and currently tailored to the human and mouse genomes. CRISPR-TE identifies all potential sgRNAs for TEs and provides a comprehensive solution for efficient TE targeting at both the single copy and subfamily levels. Our analysis shows that sgRNAs targeting TEs can more effectively target evolutionarily young TEs with conserved sequences at the subfamily level.,CRISPR-TE offers a versatile framework for designing sgRNAs for TE targeting.

"4","A systematic screen for co-option of transposable elements across the fungal kingdom","Ursula Oggenfuss, Thomas Badet and Daniel Croll","How novel protein functions are acquired is a central question in molecular biology. Key paths to novelty include gene duplications, recombination or horizontal acquisition. Transposable elements (TEs) are increasingly recognized as a major source of novel domain-encoding sequences. However, the impact of TE coding sequences on the evolution of the proteome remains understudied. Here, we analyzed 1237 genomes spanning the phylogenetic breadth of the fungal kingdom. We scanned proteomes for evidence of co-occurrence of TE-derived domains along with other conventional protein functional domains. We detected more than 13,000 predicted proteins containing potentially TE-derived domain, of which 825 were identified in more than five genomes, indicating that many host-TE fusions may have persisted over long evolutionary time scales. We used the phylogenetic context to identify the origin and retention of individual TE-derived domains. The most common TE-derived domains are helicases derived from Academ, Kolobok or Helitron. We found putative TE co-options at a higher rate in genomes of the Saccharomycotina, providing an unexpected source of protein novelty in these generally TE depleted genomes. We investigated in detail a candidate host-TE fusion with a heterochromatic transcriptional silencing function that may play a role in TE and gene regulation in ascomycetes. The affected gene underwent multiple full or partial losses within the phylum. Overall, our work establishes a kingdom-wide view of putative host-TE fusions and facilitates systematic investigations of candidate fusion proteins.","20 January 2024","","daniel.croll@unine.ch","Daniel Croll."

Lorena Ament-Velásquez, Aaron A. Vogan and Hanna Johannesson","The genome of the filamentous ascomycete Podospora anserina shows a relatively high abundance of retrotransposons compared to other interspersed repeats. The LTR-retrotransposon family crapaud is particularly abundant in the genome, and consists of multiple diverged sequence variations specifically localized in the 5’ half of both long terminal repeats (LTRs). P. anserina is part of a recently diverged species-complex, which makes the system ideal to classify the crapaud family based on the observed LTR variation and to study the evolutionary dynamics, such as the diversification and bursts of the elements over recent evolutionary time.,We developed a sequence similarity network approach to classify the crapaud repeats of seven genomes representing the P. anserina species complex into 14 subfamilies. This method does not utilize a consensus sequence, but instead it connects any copies that share enough sequence similarity over a set sequence coverage. Based on phylogenetic analyses, we found that the crapaud repeats likely diversified in the ancestor of the complex and have had activity at different time points for different subfamilies. Furthermore, while we hypothesized that the evolution into multiple subfamilies could have been a direct effect of escaping the genome defense system of repeat induced point mutations, we found this not to be the case.,Our study contributes to the development of methods to classify transposable elements in fungi, and also highlights the intricate patterns of retrotransposon evolution over short timescales and under high mutational load caused by nucleotide-altering genome defense.","13 January 2024","Fungi,Transposable elements,Retrotransposons,Genome defense,Classification","aaron.vogan@ebc.uu.se,hanna.johannesson@su.se","Aaron A.

Ryskov","The genomes of many eukaryotes contain DNA repeats in the form of both tandem and interspersed elements with distinct structure, evolutionary histories, and mechanisms of emergence and amplification. Although there is considerable knowledge regarding their diversity, there is little evidence directly linking these two types.,Different tandem repeats derived from portions of short interspersed elements (SINEs) belonging to different families were identified in 56 genomes of squamate reptiles. All loci of SINE-derived satellites (sSats) were thoroughly analyzed. Snake sSats exhibited high similarity in both structure and copy number, while other taxa may have highly diverse (geckos), rare (Darevskia lizards), or missing sSats (agamid lizards). Similar to most satellites associated with heterochromatin, sSats are likely linked to subtelomeric chromosomal regions.,Discovered tandem repeats derived from SINEs exhibit satellite-like properties, although they have not amplified to the same degree as typical satellites. The autonomous emergence of distinct sSats from diverse SINE families in numerous squamate species suggests a nonrandom process of satellite genesis originating from repetitive SINEs.","07 December 2023","Satellite DNA,Tandem repeats,SINEs,Retrotransposons,Squamata,Reptilia,Evolution","nvas@eimb.ru","Nikita S.

"8","An intronic LINE-1 regulates IFNAR1 expression in human immune cells","Carmen A. Buttler, Daniel Ramirez, Robin D. Dowell and Edward B. Chuong","Despite their origins as selfish parasitic sequences, some transposons in the human genome have been co-opted to serve as regulatory elements, contributing to the evolution of transcriptional networks. Most well-characterized examples of transposon-derived regulatory elements derive from endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), due to the intrinsic regulatory activity of proviral long terminal repeat regions. However, one subclass of transposable elements, the Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINEs), have been largely overlooked in the search for functional regulatory transposons, and considered to be broadly epigenetically repressed.,We examined the chromatin state of LINEs by analyzing epigenomic data from human immune cells. Many LINEs are marked by the repressive H3K9me3 modification, but a subset exhibits evidence of enhancer activity in human immune cells despite also showing evidence of epigenetic repression. We hypothesized that these competing forces of repressive and activating epigenetic marks might lead to inducible enhancer activity. We investigated a specific L1M2a element located within the first intron of Interferon Alpha/Beta Receptor 1 (IFNAR1). This element shows epigenetic signatures of B cell-specific enhancer activity, despite being repressed by the Human Silencing Hub (HUSH) complex. CRISPR deletion of the element in B lymphoblastoid cells revealed that the element acts as an enhancer that regulates both steady state and interferon-inducible expression of IFNAR1.,Our study experimentally demonstrates that an L1M2a element was co-opted to function as an interferon-inducible enhancer of IFNAR1, creating a feedback loop wherein IFNAR1 is transcriptionally upregulated by interferon signaling. This finding suggests that other LINEs may exhibit cryptic cell type-specific or context-dependent enhancer activity. LINEs have received less attention than ERVs in the effort to understand the contribution of transposons to the regulatory landscape of cellular genomes, but these are likely important, lineage-specific players in the rapid evolution of immune system regulatory networks and deserve further study.","30 November 2023","LINE-1,Transposons,Enhancer,Interferon","edward.chuong@colorado.edu","Edward B.

M. Ibrahim, Myriam Erz, Florian Kümmel, Ralph Panstruga and Stefan Kusch","The genome of the obligate biotrophic phytopathogenic barley powdery mildew fungus Blumeria hordei is inflated due to highly abundant and possibly active transposable elements (TEs). In the absence of the otherwise common repeat-induced point mutation transposon defense mechanism, noncoding RNAs could be key for regulating the activity of TEs and coding genes during the pathogenic life cycle.,We performed time-course whole-transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq) of total RNA derived from infected barley leaf epidermis at various stages of fungal pathogenesis and observed significant transcript accumulation and time point-dependent regulation of TEs in B. hordei. Using a manually curated consensus database of 344 TEs, we discovered phased small RNAs mapping to 104 consensus transposons, suggesting that RNA interference contributes significantly to their regulation. Further, we identified 5,127 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) genome-wide in B. hordei, of which 823 originated from the antisense strand of a TE. Co-expression network analysis of lncRNAs, TEs, and coding genes throughout the asexual life cycle of B. hordei points at extensive positive and negative co-regulation of lncRNAs, subsets of TEs and coding genes.,Our work suggests that similar to mammals and plants, fungal lncRNAs support the dynamic modulation of transcript levels, including TEs, during pivotal stages of host infection. The lncRNAs may support transcriptional diversity and plasticity amid loss of coding genes in powdery mildew fungi and may give rise to novel regulatory elements and virulence peptides, thus representing key drivers of rapid evolutionary adaptation to promote pathogenicity and overcome host defense.","15 November 2023","

Furano","L1 (LINE1) non-LTR retrotransposons are ubiquitous genomic parasites and the dominant transposable element in humans having generated about 40% of their genomic DNA during their ~ 100 million years (Myr) of activity in primates. L1 replicates in germ line cells and early embryos, causing genetic diversity and defects, but can be active in some somatic stem cells, tumors and during aging. L1 encodes two proteins essential for retrotransposition: ORF2p, a reverse transcriptase that contains an endonuclease domain, and ORF1p, a coiled coil mediated homo trimer, which functions as a nucleic acid chaperone. Both proteins contain highly conserved domains and preferentially bind their encoding transcript to form an L1 ribonucleoprotein (RNP), which mediates retrotransposition. However, the coiled coil has periodically undergone episodes of substantial amino acid replacement to the extent that a given L1 family can concurrently express multiple ORF1s that differ in the sequence of their coiled coils. Here we show that such distinct ORF1p sequences can become entangled forming heterotrimers when co-expressed from separate vectors and speculate on how coiled coil entanglement could affect coiled coil evolution.","20 October 2023","L1 retrotransposon,L1 ORF1p,Coiled coils,Coiled coil evolution","anthony.furano@nih.gov","Anthony V.

Here, through phylogenomic analyses across 7,163 cellular organisms (including 991 plants), we find that mitochondrial linear plasmids are widely present in land plants and fungi. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that plants are likely to have acquired mitochondrial linear plasmids horizontally from fungi before or during the conquest of terrestrial environments by plants. Gene content analyses show that mitochondrial linear plasmids harbor a highly dynamic and promiscuous repertoire of genes.

Here, we annotated the repetitive content in 100 genome assemblies, covering the major branches of the diverse lineage of teleost fish. We investigated if TE content correlates with family level net diversification rates and found support for a weak negative correlation. Further, we demonstrated that TE proportion correlates with genome size, but not to the proportion of short tandem repeats (STRs), which implies independent evolutionary paths. Marine and freshwater fish had large differences in STR content, with the most extreme propagation detected in the genomes of codfish species and Atlantic herring. Such a high density of STRs is likely to increase the mutational load, which we propose could be counterbalanced by high fecundity as seen in codfishes and herring.","03 October 2023","Transposable elements,Short tandem repeats,Diversification,Repetitive DNA,Genome size,Genome dynamics","w.b.reinar@ibv.uio.no,k.s.jakobsen@ibv.uio.no","William B.

The L1 5´ untranslated region (UTR) also contains antisense promoter (ASP) activity, generating L1-gene chimeric transcripts to a neighbor exon. Some of these ASP-associated genes have been reported to be overexpressed in cancer and promote cancer cell growth. However, little is known about overall expression patterns and the roles of L1 ASP-associated genes in human cancers.,L1 ASP-associated genes were frequently dysregulated in cancer and associated with the cell cycle, the PI3K/AKT pathway, and the GTPase signaling pathway.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small and highly conserved RNA molecules that serve as key post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. The origin and subsequent evolution of miRNAs have been addressed but not fully elucidated.,In this study, we performed a comprehensive investigation of miRNA origination through retroduplicated mRNA sequences (retro-miRs). We identified 17 retro-miRs that emerged from the mRNA retrocopies. Four of these retro-miRs had de novo origins within retrocopied sequences, while 13 retro-miRNAs were located within exon regions and duplicated along with their host mRNAs. We found that retro-miRs were primate-specific, including five retro-miRs conserved among all primates and two human-specific retro-miRs. All retro-miRs were expressed, with predicted and experimentally validated target genes except miR-10527. Notably, the target genes of retro-miRs are involved in key biological processes such as metabolic processes, cell signaling, and regulation of neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. Additionally, we found that these retro-miRs play a potential oncogenic role in cancer by targeting key cancer genes and are overexpressed in several cancer types, including liver hepatocellular carcinoma and stomach adenocarcinoma.,Our findings demonstrated that mRNA retrotransposition is a key mechanism for the generation of novel miRNAs (retro-miRs) in primates.

Individual PIWI proteins combine these modules in various ways to produce unique PIWI-piRNA pathways, which nevertheless possess the ability to perform conserved functions. This modular model incorporates conserved core mechanisms and accommodates variable co-factors. Adaptability is a hallmark of this RNA-based immune system.

"19","Transposable elements as essential elements in the control of gene expression","Alemu Gebrie","Interspersed repetitions called transposable elements (TEs), commonly referred to as mobile elements, make up a significant portion of the genomes of higher animals. TEs contribute in controlling the expression of genes locally and even far away at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, which is one of their significant functional effects on gene function and genome evolution. There are different mechanisms through which TEs control the expression of genes. First, TEs offer cis-regulatory regions in the genome with their inherent regulatory features for their own expression, making them potential factors for controlling the expression of the host genes. Promoter and enhancer elements contain cis-regulatory sites generated from TE, which function as binding sites for a variety of trans-acting factors. Second, a significant portion of miRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to have TEs that encode for regulatory RNAs, revealing the TE origin of these RNAs. Furthermore, it was shown that TE sequences are essential for these RNAs' regulatory actions, which include binding to the target mRNA. By being a member of cis-regulatory and regulatory RNA sequences, TEs therefore play essential regulatory roles. Additionally, it has been suggested that TE-derived regulatory RNAs and cis-regulatory regions both contribute to the evolutionary novelty of gene regulation. Additionally, these regulatory systems arising from TE frequently have tissue-specific functions. The objective of this review is to discuss TE-mediated gene regulation, with a particular emphasis on the processes, contributions of various TE types, differential roles of various tissue types, based mostly on recent studies on humans.","18 August 2023","Transposable elements,Mobile elements,Gene expression","alemugebrie2@gmail.com","Alemu Gebrie."

The diversity and complexity of such methods often present challenges to new users seeking to reproducibly install, execute, or evaluate multiple TE insertion detectors.,We previously developed the McClintock meta-pipeline to facilitate the installation, execution, and evaluation of six first-generation short-read TE detectors. Here, we report a completely re-implemented version of McClintock written in Python using Snakemake and Conda that improves its installation, error handling, speed, stability, and extensibility. McClintock 2 now includes 12 short-read TE detectors, auxiliary pre-processing and analysis modules, interactive HTML reports, and a simulation framework to reproducibly evaluate the accuracy of component TE detectors. When applied to the model microbial eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we find substantial variation in the ability of McClintock 2 components to identify the precise locations of non-reference TE insertions, with RelocaTE2 showing the highest recall and precision in simulated data. We find that RelocaTE2, TEMP, TEMP2 and TEBreak provide consistent estimates of \(\sim\)50 non-reference TE insertions per strain and that Ty2 has the highest number of non-reference TE insertions in a species-wide panel of \(\sim\)1000 yeast genomes. Finally, we show that best-in-class predictors for yeast applied to resequencing data have sufficient resolution to reveal a dyad pattern of integration in nucleosome-bound regions upstream of yeast tRNA genes for Ty1, Ty2, and Ty4, allowing us to extend knowledge about fine-scale target preferences revealed previously for experimentally-induced Ty1 insertions to spontaneous insertions for other copia-superfamily retrotransposons in yeast.,McClintock (https://github.com/bergmanlab/mcclintock/) provides a user-friendly pipeline for the identification of TEs in short-read WGS data using multiple TE detectors, which should benefit researchers studying TE insertion variation in a wide range of different organisms. Application of the improved McClintock system to simulated and empirical yeast genome data reveals best-in-class methods and novel biological insights for one of the most widely-studied model eukaryotes and provides a paradigm for evaluating and selecting non-reference TE detectors in other species.","14 July 2023","Bioinformatics,High-throughput sequencing,

The transposition mode and the prevalence of SEs in prokaryotes remain vague.,To corroborate the transposition mode and the prevalence of SEs, hypothetical transposition intermediates of an SE were searched for in genomic DNA fractions of an SE host. Then, the SE core genes were defined based on gene knockout experiments, and the synteny blocks of their distant homologs were searched for in the RefSeq complete genome sequence database using PSI-BLAST. A genomic DNA fractionation experiment revealed that SE copies are present in a double-stranded nicked circular form in vivo. Operonic structure of three conserved coding sequences (intA, tfp, intB) and srap located at the left end of SEs were identified as essential for attL × attR recombination. The synteny blocks of tfp and srap homologs were detected in 3.6% of the replicons of Gammaproteobacteria but not in other taxa, implying that SE movement is host-dependent. SEs have been discovered most frequently in the orders Vibrionales (19% of replicons), Pseudomonadales (18%), Alteromonadales (17%), and Aeromonadales (12%). Genomic comparisons revealed 35 new SE members with identifiable termini. SEs are present at 1 to 2 copies per replicon and have a median length of 15.7 kb. Three newly identified SE members carry antimicrobial resistance genes, like tmexCD-toprJ, mcr-9, and blaGMA-1. Further experiments validated that three new SE members possess the strand-biased attL × attR recombination activity.,This study suggested that transposition intermediates of SEs are double-stranded circular DNA. The main hosts of SEs are a subset of free-living Gammaproteobacteria; this represents a rather narrow host range compared to those of mobile DNA element groups discovered to date. As the host range, genetic organization, and movements are unique among the mobile DNA elements, SEs provide a new model system for host-mobile DNA element coevolution studies.","26 May 2023","Integrase,SE,GInt,RIT,ICE,IME,Copy-out,MexCD-OprJ,

Dunn-Fletcher et al. reported one THE1B element upstream of CRH gene alters gestation length by upregulating corticotropin-releasing hormone expression in transgenic mice and concluded it has the same role in human as well. However, no promoter or enhancer mark has been detected around this CRH-proximal element in any human tissue or cell, so probably some anti-viral factor exists in primates to prevents it from wreaking havoc. Here I report two paralogous zinc finger genes, ZNF430 and ZNF100, that emerged during the simian lineage to specifically silence THE1B and THE1A, respectively. Contact residue changes in one finger confers each ZNF the unique ability to preferentially repress one THE1 sub-family over the other. The reported THE1B element contains an intact ZNF430 binding site, thus under the repression of ZNF430 in most tissues including placenta, it is questionable whether or not this retrovirus has any role in human pregnancy. Overall, this analysis highlights the need to study human retroviruses’ functions in suitable model system.","22 May 2023","ZNF430,ZNF100,THE1B,THE1A,CRH","zeropin@live.cn","Zheng Zuo."

Here, we report (i) which immune cells ORF1p emanates from, (ii) which L1 loci are transcriptionally active, (iii) whether the cells express L1-dependent interferon and interferon-stimulated genes, and (iv) the effect of inhibition of L1 ORF2p by reverse transcriptase inhibitors.,L1 ORF1p was detected by flow cytometry primarily in SLE CD66b+CD15+ regular and low-density granulocytes, but much less in other immune cell lineages. The amount of ORF1p was higher in neutrophils from patients with SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) > 6 (p = 0.011) compared to patients with inactive disease, SLEDAI < 4. Patient neutrophils transcribed seven to twelve human-specific L1 loci (L1Hs), but only 3 that are full-length and with an intact ORF1. Besides serving as a source of detectable ORF1p, the most abundant transcript encoded a truncated ORF2p reverse transcriptase predicted to remain cytosolic, while the two other encoded an intact full-length ORF2p. A number of genes encoding proteins that influence L1 transcription positively or negatively were altered in patients, particularly those with active disease, compared to healthy controls. Components of nucleic acid sensing and interferon induction were also altered. SLE neutrophils also expressed type I interferon-inducible genes and interferon β, which were substantially reduced after treatment of the cells with drugs known to inhibit ORF2p reverse transcriptase activity.,We identified L1Hs loci that are transcriptionally active in SLE neutrophils, and a reduction in the epigenetic silencing mechanisms that normally counteract L1 transcription. SLE neutrophils contained L1-encoded ORF1p protein, as well as activation of the type I interferon system, which was inhibited by treatment with reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Our findings will enable a deeper analysis of L1 dysregulation and its potential role in SLE pathogenesis.","10 May 2023","L1,Retrotransposon,Systemic lupus erythematosus,Neutrophils,Interferon","tomas2@uw.edu","Tomas Mustelin."

Choy","Antimicrobial resistant pathogens are a global health threat driven by the indiscriminate use of antimicrobials. Antimicrobial resistance can be acquired by resistance genes encoded by mobile genetic elements. In this study, we identified a strain of Salmonella enterica serovar Gallinarum (SG4021) from an infected chicken in Korea and characterized the presence of resistance genes in its plasmid by whole genome sequencing. The sequence was then compared with that of a plasmid (P2) from strain SG_07Q015, the only other strain of S. Gallinarum isolated in Korea for which a genome sequence is available. The results revealed that both strains harbored nearly identical DNA carrying antibiotic resistance gene cassettes inserted into integron In2 of the transposable element Tn21, namely an aadA1 resistance gene conferring resistance to aminoglycosides and a sul1 resistance gene conferring resistance to sulfonamide. Interestingly, despite the presence of sul1 in SG4021, an antibiotic sensitivity test revealed that it was sensitive to sulfonamides. Further analysis revealed that this disparity was due to the insertion of a ~ 5 kb ISCR16 sequence downstream of the promoter driving sul1 expression in SG4021. Using various mutants, we showed that the insertion of ISCR16 blocked the expression of the sul1 gene from the upstream promoter. Therefore, the functionality of antimicrobial resistance genes determines phenotypic antimicrobial resistance.","24 April 2023","

However, there are examples of non-canonical telomeres among eukaryotes where telomeric tandem repeats are invaded by specific retrotransposons. Drosophila melanogaster represents an extreme example with telomeres composed solely by three retrotransposons—Het-A, TAHRE and TART (HTT). Even though non-canonical telomeres often show strand biased G-distribution, the evidence for the G4-forming potential is limited.,Using circular dichroism spectroscopy and UV absorption melting assay we have verified in vitro G4-formation in the HTT elements of D. melanogaster. Namely 3 in Het-A, 8 in TART and 2 in TAHRE. All the G4s are asymmetrically distributed as in canonical telomeres. Bioinformatic analysis showed that asymmetric distribution of potential quadruplex sequences (PQS) is common in telomeric retrotransposons in other Drosophila species. Most of the PQS are located in the gag gene where PQS density correlates with higher DNA sequence conservation and codon selection favoring G4-forming potential. The importance of G4s in non-canonical telomeres is further supported by analysis of telomere-associated retrotransposons from various eukaryotic species including green algae, Diplomonadida, fungi, insects and vertebrates. Virtually all analyzed telomere-associated retrotransposons contained PQS, frequently with asymmetric strand distribution. Comparison with non-telomeric elements showed independent selection of PQS-rich elements from four distinct LINE clades.,Our findings of strand-biased G4-forming motifs in telomere-associated retrotransposons from various eukaryotic species support the G4-formation as one of the prerequisites for the recruitment of specific retrotransposons to chromosome ends and call for further experimental studies.","10 April 2023","Telomere,G-quadruplex,Retrotransposon,

Activation of transposable elements (TE) can trigger an innate immune response, which can synergize with immunotherapeutic protocols in patients. However, TE activity in relation to immune gene response is not fully known in human SCLC. Here, we compared TE expression in 104 human SCLC and 24 normal tissues and established their involvement in innate immune responses. We observed that different intergenic TEs, mainly endogenous retroviral (ERV) families, are deregulated in SCLC. Similarly to other cancers, we detected a subset of LTRs that correlate with innate immune gene signatures and cytosolic RNA sensors, such as RIG-I. These LTRs are downregulated in SCLC tumors vs. normal tissues, and are mainly located at transcriptional repressed regions, marked with H3K4me2 in different cell lines. Analyses of different genomic datasets show that chromatin repression is likely due to de-methylase LSD1 activity. Moreover, high expression levels of ERV LTRs predict a better survival upon chemotherapy of SCLC patients. The findings reveal a specific pattern of TE-mediated activation of innate immune genes in SCLC, which can be exploited to establish more effective immunotherapeutic combinations.","14 March 2023","Small-cell lung cancer,Transposable elements,Innate immune response,Cytoplasmic RNA sensors,Cancer treatment","giovanni.capranico@unibo.it","Giovanni Capranico."
"27","Mobility of mPing and its associated elements is regulated by both internal and terminal sequences","Priscilla S. Redd, Stephanie Diaz, David Weidner, Jazmine Benjamin and C. Nathan Hancock","DNA transposable elements are mobilized by a “cut and paste” mechanism catalyzed by the binding of one or more transposase proteins to terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) to form a transpositional complex. Study of the rice genome indicates that the mPing element has experienced a recent burst in transposition compared to the closely related Ping and Pong elements. A previously developed yeast transposition assay allowed us to probe the role of both internal and terminal sequences in the mobilization of these elements.,We observed that mPing and a synthetic mPong element have significantly higher transposition efficiency than the related autonomous Ping and Pong elements. Systematic mutation of the internal sequences of both mPing and mPong identified multiple regions that promote or inhibit transposition. Simultaneous alteration of single bases on both mPing TIRs resulted in a significant reduction in transposition frequency, indicating that each base plays a role in efficient transposase binding. Testing chimeric mPing and mPong elements verified the important role of both the TIRs and internal regulatory regions. Previous experiments showed that the G at position 16, adjacent to the 5′ TIR, allows mPing to have higher mobility. Alteration of the 16th and 17th base from mPing’s 3′ end or replacement of the 3′ end with Pong 3′ sequences significantly increased transposition frequency.,As the transposase proteins were consistent throughout this study, we conclude that the observed transposition differences are due to the element sequences. The presence of sub-optimal internal regions and TIR bases supports a model in which transposable elements self-limit their activity to prevent host damage and detection by host regulatory mechanisms. Knowing the role of the TIRs, adjacent sub-TIRs, and internal regulatory sequences allows for the creation of hyperactive elements.","11 February 2023","

W. Geering, Pierre-Yves Teycheney and Florian Maumus","Plant, animal and protist genomes often contain endogenous viral elements (EVEs), which correspond to partial and sometimes entire viral genomes that have been captured in the genome of their host organism through a variety of integration mechanisms. While the number of sequenced eukaryotic genomes is rapidly increasing, the annotation and characterization of EVEs remains largely overlooked. EVEs that derive from members of the family Caulimoviridae are widespread across tracheophyte plants, and sometimes they occur in very high copy numbers. However, existing programs for annotating repetitive DNA elements in plant genomes are poor at identifying and then classifying these EVEs. Other than accurately annotating plant genomes, there is intrinsic value in a tool that could identify caulimovirid EVEs as they testify to recent or ancient host-virus interactions and provide valuable insights into virus evolution. In response to this research need, we have developed CAULIFINDER, an automated and sensitive annotation software package. CAULIFINDER consists of two complementary workflows, one to reconstruct, annotate and group caulimovirid EVEs in a given plant genome and the second to classify these genetic elements into officially recognized or tentative genera in the Caulimoviridae. We have benchmarked the CAULIFINDER package using the Vitis vinifera reference genome, which contains a rich assortment of caulimovirid EVEs that have previously been characterized using manual methods. The CAULIFINDER package is distributed in the form of a Docker image.","03 December 2022","Endogenous viral elements,Plant genomes,Paleovirology,

Abrams","LINE-1s, Alus and SVAs are the only retrotransposition competent elements in humans. Their mobilization followed by insertional mutagenesis is often linked to disease. Apart from these rare integration events, accumulation of retrotransposition intermediates in the cytoplasm is potentially pathogenic due to induction of inflammatory response pathways. Although the retrotransposition of LINE-1 and Alu retroelements has been studied in considerable detail, there are mixed observations about the localization of their RNAs.,We undertook a comprehensive and unbiased approach to analyze retroelement RNA localization using common cell lines and publicly available datasets containing RNA-sequencing data from subcellular fractions. Using our customized analytic pipeline, we compared localization patterns of RNAs transcribed from retroelements and single-copy protein coding genes. Our results demonstrate a generalized characteristic pattern of retroelement RNA nuclear localization that is conserved across retroelement classes as well as evolutionarily young and ancient elements. Preferential nuclear enrichment of retroelement transcripts was consistently observed in cell lines, in vivo and across species. Moreover, retroelement RNA localization patterns were dynamic and subject to change during development, as seen in zebrafish embryos.,The pronounced nuclear localization of transcripts arising from ancient as well as de novo transcribed retroelements suggests that these transcripts are retained in the nucleus as opposed to being re-imported to the nucleus or degraded in the cytoplasm. This raises the possibility that there is adaptive value associated with this localization pattern to the host, the retroelements or possibly both.","02 December 2022","Retroelements,RNA,Nuclear localization,RNA-sequencing,LINE-1,Development,Retrotransposition","john.abrams@utsouthwestern.edu","John M.

"31","T3E: a tool for characterising the epigenetic profile of transposable elements using ChIP-seq data","Michelle Almeida da Paz and Leila Taher","Despite the advent of Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (ChIP-seq) having revolutionised our understanding of the mammalian genome’s regulatory landscape, many challenges remain. In particular, because of their repetitive nature, the sequencing reads derived from transposable elements (TEs) pose a real bioinformatics challenge, to the point that standard analysis pipelines typically ignore reads whose genomic origin cannot be unambiguously ascertained.,We show that discarding ambiguously mapping reads may lead to a systematic underestimation of the number of reads associated with young TE families/subfamilies. We also provide evidence suggesting that the strategy of randomly permuting the location of the read mappings (or the TEs) that is often used to compute the background for enrichment calculations at TE families/subfamilies can result in both false positive and negative enrichments. To address these problems, we present the Transposable Element Enrichment Estimator (T3E), a tool that makes use of ChIP-seq data to characterise the epigenetic profile of associated TE families/subfamilies. T3E weights the number of read mappings assigned to the individual TE copies of a family/subfamily by the overall number of genomic loci to which the corresponding reads map, and this is done at the single nucleotide level. In addition, T3E computes ChIP-seq enrichment relative to a background estimated based on the distribution of the read mappings in the input control DNA.,We demonstrated the capabilities of T3E on 23 different ChIP-seq libraries. T3E identified enrichments that were consistent with previous studies. Furthermore, T3E detected context-specific enrichments that are likely to pinpoint unexplored TE families/subfamilies with individual TE copies that have been frequently exapted as cis-regulatory elements during the evolution of mammalian regulatory networks.,T3E is a novel open-source computational tool (available for use at: https://github.com/michelleapaz/T3E) that overcomes some of the pitfalls associated with the analysis of ChIP-seq data arising from the repetitive mammalian genome and provides a framework to shed light on the epigenetics of entire TE families/subfamilies.","30 November 2022","Transposable element,ChIP-seq,Enrichment,Background signal,Input control,Epigenetics","leila.taher@tugraz.at","Leila Taher."

Ruma, Claudio Casola, Ayda Mirsalehi and Esther Betrán","Transposable elements (TEs) are selfish DNA sequences capable of moving and amplifying at the expense of host cells. Despite this, an increasing number of studies have revealed that TE proteins are important contributors to the emergence of novel host proteins through molecular domestication. We previously described seven transposase-derived domesticated genes from the PIF/Harbinger DNA family of TEs in Drosophila and a co-domestication. All PIF TEs known in plants and animals distinguish themselves from other DNA transposons by the presence of two genes. We hypothesize that there should often be co-domestications of the two genes from the same TE because the transposase (gene 1) has been described to be translocated to the nucleus by the MADF protein (gene 2). To provide support for this model of new gene origination, we investigated available insect species genomes for additional evidence of PIF TE domestication events and explored the co-domestication of the MADF protein from the same TE insertion.,After the extensive insect species genomes exploration of hits to PIF transposases and analyses of their context and evolution, we present evidence of at least six independent PIF transposable elements proteins domestication events in insects: two co-domestications of both transposase and MADF proteins in Anopheles (Diptera), one transposase-only domestication event and one co-domestication in butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera), and two transposases-only domestication events in cockroaches (Blattodea). The predicted nuclear localization signals for many of those proteins and dicistronic transcription in some instances support the functional associations of co-domesticated transposase and MADF proteins.,Our results add to a co-domestication that we previously described in fruit fly genomes and support that new gene origination through domestication of a PIF transposase is frequently accompanied by the co-domestication of a cognate MADF protein in insects, potentially for regulatory functions. We propose a detailed model that predicts that PIF TE protein co-domestication should often occur from the same PIF TE insertion.","30 November 2022","PIF/harbinger transposable element,Molecular domestication,Insects","betran@uta.edu","Esther Betrán."

Throughout evolution and over time, Primates and Homo had to cope with infections from viruses and bacteria, and also with endogenous retroelements. Therefore, host genomes have evolved numerous methods to counteract the activity of endogenous and exogenous pathogens, and the APOBEC3 family of mutators is a prime example of a defensive mechanism in this context.,In most Primates, there are seven members of the APOBEC3 family of deaminase proteins: among their functions, there is the ability to inhibit the mobilization of retrotransposons and the functionality of viruses. The evolution of the APOBEC3 proteins found in Primates is correlated with the expansion of two major families of retrotransposons, i.e. ERV and LINE-1.,In this review, we will discuss how the rapid expansion of the APOBEC3 family is linked to the evolution of retrotransposons, highlighting the strong evolutionary arms race that characterized the history of APOBEC3s and endogenous retroelements in Primates.

Since excessive transposition can be mutagenic, mechanisms exist in the cells to keep these mobile elements under control. Although many cellular factors regulating the mobility of the retrovirus-like transposon Ty1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been identified in genetic screens, only very few of them interact physically with Ty1 integrase (IN).,Here, we perform a proteomic screen to establish Ty1 IN interactome. Among the 265 potential interacting partners, we focus our study on the conserved CK2 kinase. We confirm the interaction between IN and CK2, demonstrate that IN is a substrate of CK2 in vitro and identify the modified residues. We find that Ty1 IN is phosphorylated in vivo and that these modifications are dependent in part on CK2. No significant change in Ty1 retromobility could be observed when we introduce phospho-ablative mutations that prevent IN phosphorylation by CK2 in vitro. However, the absence of CK2 holoenzyme results in a strong stimulation of Ty1 retrotransposition, characterized by an increase in Ty1 mRNA and protein levels and a high accumulation of cDNA.,Our study shows that Ty1 IN is phosphorylated, as observed for retroviral INs and highlights an important role of CK2 in the regulation of Ty1 retrotransposition. In addition, the proteomic approach enabled the identification of many new Ty1 IN interacting partners, whose potential role in the control of Ty1 mobility will be interesting to study.","18 November 2022","Ty1,Integrase,Proteomic,CK2 protein kinase,Phosphorylation,Retrotransposition,

It is challenging to dissect the distinct functions of these transcription regulators due to their sequence similarity and diversity, and also the complicated repetitiveness of their targeting TE sequences.,Mouse KRAB-Zfps are mainly organized into clusters genomewide. In this study, we revealed that the intra-cluster members had a close evolutionary relationship, and a similar preference for zinc finger (ZnF) usage. KRAB-Zfps were expressed in a cell type- or tissue type specific manner and they tended to be actively transcribed together with other cluster members. Further sequence analyses pointed out the linker sequences in between ZnFs were conserved, and meanwhile had distinct cluster specificity. Based on these unique characteristics of KRAB-Zfp clusters, sgRNAs were designed to edit cluster-specific linkers to abolish the functions of the targeted cluster(s). Using mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) as a model, we screened and obtained a series of sgRNAs targeting various highly expressed KRAB-Zfp clusters. The effectiveness of sgRNAs were verified in a reporter assay exclusively developed for multi-target sgRNAs and further confirmed by PCR-based analyses. Using mESC cell lines inducibly expressing Cas9 and these sgRNAs, we found that editing different KRAB-Zfp clusters resulted in the transcriptional changes of distinct categories of TEs.,Collectively, the intrinsic sequence correlations of intra-cluster KRAB-Zfp members discovered in this study suggest that the conserved cluster specific linkers played crucial roles in diversifying the tandem ZnF array and the related target specificity of KRAB-Zfps during clusters’ evolution. On this basis, an effective CRISPR-Cas9 based approach against the linker sequences is developed and verified for rapidly editing KRAB-Zfp clusters to identify the regulatory correlation between the cluster members and their potential TE targets.","10 November 2022","

Kojima and Weidong Bao","DNA transposons are ubiquitous components of eukaryotic genomes. A major group of them encode a DDD/E transposase and contain terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) of varying lengths. The Kolobok superfamily of DNA transposons has been found in a wide spectrum of organisms.,Here we report a new Kolobok lineage, designated KolobokP. They were identified in 7 animal phyla (Mollusca, Phoronida, Annelida, Nemertea, Bryozoa, Chordata, and Echinodermata), and are especially rich in bivalves. Unlike other Kolobok families, KolobokP adopts a composite-like architecture: an internal region (INT) flanked by two long terminal direct repeats (LTDRs), which exhibit their own short terminal inverted repeats ranging up to 18 bps. The excision of LTDRs was strongly suggested. The LTDR lengths seem to be constrained to be either around 450-bp or around 660-bp. The internal region encodes a DDD/E transposase and a small His-Me finger nuclease, which likely originated from the homing endonuclease encoded by a group I intron from a eukaryotic species. The architecture of KolobokP resembles composite DNA transposons, usually observed in bacterial genomes, and long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons. In addition to this monomeric LTDR-INT-LTDR structure, plenty of solo LTDRs and multimers represented as (LTDR-INT)n-LTDR are also observed. Our structural and phylogenetic analysis supported the birth of KolobokP in the late stage of the Kolobok evolution. We propose KolobokP families propagate themselves in two ways: the canonical transposition catalyzed by their transposase and the sequence-specific cleavage by their endonuclease followed by the multimerization through the unequal crossover.,The presence of homing endonuclease and long terminal direct repeats of KolobokP families suggest their unique dual replication mechanisms: transposition and induced unequal crossover.","22 October 2022","DNA transposon,

Nuclear ribosomal DNA of some fungi and protists contain mobile group I introns harboring His-Cys homing endonuclease genes (HEGs). An intriguing question is how protein-coding genes embedded in nuclear ribosomal DNA become expressed. To address this gap of knowledge we analyzed nuclear L2066 group I introns from myxomycetes and ascomycetes.,A total of 34 introns were investigated, including two identified mobile-type introns in myxomycetes with HEGs oriented in sense or antisense directions. Intriguingly, both HEGs are interrupted by spliceosomal introns. The intron in Didymium squamulosum, which harbors an antisense oriented HEG, was investigated in more detail. The group I intron RNA self-splices in vitro, thus generating ligated exons and full-length intron circles. The intron HEG is expressed in vivo in Didymium cells, which involves removal of a 47-nt spliceosomal intron (I-47) and 3′ polyadenylation of the mRNA. The D. squamulosum HEG (lacking the I-47 intron) was over-expressed in E. coli, and the corresponding protein was purified and shown to confer endonuclease activity. The homing endonuclease was shown to cleave an intron-lacking DNA and to produce a pentanucleotide 3′ overhang at the intron insertion site.,The L2066 family of nuclear group I introns all belong to the group IE subclass. The D. squamulosum L2066 intron contains major hallmarks of a true mobile group I intron by encoding a His-Cys homing endonuclease that generates a double-strand break at the DNA insertion site.

Our transcriptome reassembly identified multiple ISGs that have acquired novel exons from bat-specific TEs, including NLRC5, SLNF5 and a previously unannotated isoform of the IFITM2 gene. We also identified examples of TE-derived regulatory elements, but did not find strong evidence supporting genome-wide epigenetic activation of TEs in response to IFN.,Collectively, our study uncovers numerous TE-derived transcripts, proteins, and alternative isoforms that are induced by IFN in Myotis lucifugus cells, highlighting candidate loci that may contribute to bat-specific immune function.","06 September 2022","Bat immunity,Transposable elements,Epigenomics","edward.chuong@colorado.edu","Edward B.

"39","SCIFER: approach for analysis of LINE-1 mRNA expression in single cells at a single locus resolution","Emily C. Stow, Melody Baddoo, Alexis J. LaRosa, Dawn LaCoste, Prescott Deininger and Victoria Belancio","Endogenous expression of L1 mRNA is the first step in an L1-initiated mutagenesis event. However, the contribution of individual cell types to patterns of organ-specific L1 mRNA expression remains poorly understood, especially at single-locus resolution. We introduce a method to quantify expression of mobile elements at the single-locus resolution in scRNA-Seq datasets called Single Cell Implementation to Find Expressed Retrotransposons (SCIFER). SCIFER aligns scRNA-Seq reads uniquely to the genome and extracts alignments from single cells by cell-specific barcodes. In contrast to the alignment performed using default parameters, this alignment strategy increases accuracy of L1 locus identification by retaining only reads that are uniquely mapped to individual L1 loci. L1 loci expressed in single cells are unambiguously identified using a list of L1 loci manually validated to be expressed in bulk RNA-Seq datasets generated from the same cell line or organ.,Validation of SCIFER using MCF7 cells determined technical parameters needed for optimal detection of L1 expression in single cells. We show that unsupervised analysis of L1 expression in single cells exponentially inflates both the levels of L1 expression and the number of expressed L1 loci. Application of SCIFER to analysis of scRNA-Seq datasets generated from mouse and human testes identified that mouse Round Spermatids and human Spermatogonia, Spermatocytes, and Round Spermatids express the highest levels of L1 mRNA. Our analysis also determined that similar to mice, human testes from unrelated individuals share as much as 80% of expressed L1 loci. Additionally, SCIFER determined that individual mouse cells co-express different L1 sub-families and different families of transposable elements, experimentally validating their co-existence in the same cell.,SCIFER detects mRNA expression of individual L1 loci in single cells. It is compatible with scRNA-Seq datasets prepared using traditional sequencing methods. Validated using a human cancer cell line, SCIFER analysis of mouse and human testes identified key cell types supporting L1 expression in these species. This will further our understanding of differences and similarities in endogenous L1 mRNA expression patterns in mice and humans.","26 August 2022","LINE1,Mobile element,Retroelement,LTR,Single cell,RNA sequencing,Expression,Testis","vperepe@tulane.edu","Victoria Belancio."
"40","Multiple horizontal transfers of a Helitron transposon associated with a parasitoid wasp","Pedro Heringer and Gustavo C. S. Kuhn","In a previous study we described a Helitron transposon that apparently became one of the segments in the symbiotic Cotesia vestalis bracovirus (CvBV) from the parasitoid wasp C. vestalis. We presented evidence that this Helitron, named Hel_c35, invaded the C. vestalis genome through a horizontal transfer (HT) event from a dipteran and was later transferred horizontally from C. vestalis to a lepidopteran species. Based on the phylogeny of Hel_c35, we suggested that both HTs occurred in East Asia. We have also anticipated that, as more sequenced genomes from new species become available, more HTs involving Hel_c35 would be detected. Although the inclusion of Hel_c35 as a CvBV segment turned out to be a methodological artifact, the fact that Hel_c35 copies are present in the genomes of C. vestalis and other arthropods still remains. Here, we investigated the evolution of Hel_c35 in arthropods using an updated data set to reassess our previous findings. Most species (95%) included in the present work had their genomes sequenced after our initial study was published, thus representing new descriptions of taxa harboring Hel_c35. Our results expand considerably the number of putative HTs involving Hel_c35, with up to dozens of previously undescribed events, and suggest that the most recent HTs associated with C. vestalis took place in Europe. Considering the phylogenetic distribution of Hel_c35, and the evidence that its DNA sequences are present in the calyx fluid of C. vestalis and tissues from its parasitized host, we argue that many HT events were favored by the behavior of this wasp.","19 August 2022","

However, the characteristics of expressed TE loci, the identification of self-competent transposon loci contributing to new insertions, and the genomic conditions permitting their mobilisation remain largely unknown.,Using Vitis vinifera embryogenic callus, we explored the impact of biotic stressors on transposon transcription through the exposure of the callus to live cultures of an endemic grapevine yeast, Hanseniaspora uvarum. We found that only 1.7–2.5% of total annotated TE loci were transcribed, of which 5–10% of these were full-length, and the expressed TE loci exhibited a strong location bias towards expressed genes. These trends in transposon transcription were also observed in RNA-seq data from Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type plants but not in epigenetically compromised Arabidopsis ddm1 mutants. Moreover, differentially expressed TE loci in the grapevine tended to share expression patterns with co-localised differentially expressed genes. Utilising nanopore cDNA sequencing, we found a strong correlation between the inclusion of intronic TEs in gene transcripts and the presence of premature termination codons in these transcripts. Finally, we identified low levels of full-length transcripts deriving from structurally intact TE loci in the grapevine model.,Our observations in two disparate plant models representing clonally and seed propagated plant species reveal a closely connected transcriptional relationship between TEs and co-localised genes, particularly when epigenetic silencing is not compromised. We found that the stress treatment alone was insufficient to induce large-scale full-length transcription from structurally intact TE loci, a necessity for non-autonomous and autonomous mobilisation.","12 May 2022","Transposable element,Stress treatment,Transcription,Differential expression,Alternative splicing,Nanopore sequencing","christopher.winefield@lincoln.ac.nz","Christopher Winefield."

However, despite their relevance the identification of TEs is not an easy task and a number of tools were developed to tackle this problem. To better understand how they perform, we tested several widely used tools for de novo TE detection and compared their performance on both simulated data and well curated genomic sequences. As expected, tools that build TE-models performed better than k-mer counting ones, with RepeatModeler beating competitors in most datasets. However, there is a tendency for most tools to identify TE-regions in a fragmented manner and it is also frequent that small TEs or fragmented TEs are not detected. Consequently, the identification of TEs is still a challenging endeavor and it requires a significant manual curation by an experienced expert.

Newkirk and Wenfeng An","The internal promoter in L1 5’UTR is critical for autonomous L1 transcription and initiating retrotransposition. Unlike the human genome, which features one contemporarily active subfamily, four subfamilies (A_I, Gf_I and Tf_I/II) have been amplifying in the mouse genome in the last one million years. Moreover, mouse L1 5’UTRs are organized into tandem repeats called monomers, which are separated from ORF1 by a tether domain. In this study, we aim to compare promoter activities across young mouse L1 subfamilies and investigate the contribution of individual monomers and the tether sequence.,We observed an inverse relationship between subfamily age and the average number of monomers among evolutionarily young mouse L1 subfamilies. The youngest subgroup (A_I and Tf_I/II) on average carry 3–4 monomers in the 5’UTR. Using a single-vector dual-luciferase reporter assay, we compared promoter activities across six L1 subfamilies (A_I/II, Gf_I and Tf_I/II/III) and established their antisense promoter activities in a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line and a mouse embryonal carcinoma cell line. Using consensus promoter sequences for three subfamilies (A_I, Gf_I and Tf_I), we dissected the differential roles of individual monomers and the tether domain in L1 promoter activity. We validated that, across multiple subfamilies, the second monomer consistently enhances the overall promoter activity. For individual promoter components, monomer 2 is consistently more active than the corresponding monomer 1 and/or the tether for each subfamily. Importantly, we revealed intricate interactions between monomer 2, monomer 1 and tether domains in a subfamily-specific manner. Furthermore, using three-monomer 5’UTRs, we established a complex nonlinear relationship between the length of the outmost monomer and the overall promoter activity.,The laboratory mouse is an important mammalian model system for human diseases as well as L1 biology.

The Bemisia tabaci whitefly species complex is the most damaging in terms of its broad crop host range and its ability to serve as vector for over 400 plant viruses. Genomes of whiteflies belonging to this species complex have provided valuable genomic data; however, transposable elements (TEs) within these genomes remain unexplored. This study provides the first accurate characterization of TE content within the B. tabaci species complex.,This study identified that an average of 40.61% of the genomes of three whitefly species (MEAM1, MEDQ, and SSA-ECA) consists of TEs. The majority of the TEs identified were DNA transposons (22.85% average) while SINEs (0.14% average) were the least represented. This study also compared the TE content of the three whitefly genomes with three other hemipteran genomes and found significantly more DNA transposons and less LINEs in the whitefly genomes. A total of 63 TE superfamilies were identified to be present across the three whitefly species (39 DNA transposons, six LTR, 16 LINE, and two SINE). The sequences of the identified TEs were clustered which generated 5766 TE clusters. A total of 2707 clusters were identified as uniquely found within the whitefly genomes while none of the generated clusters were from both whitefly and non-whitefly TE sequences.,This study is the first to characterize TEs found within different B. tabaci species and has created a standardized annotation workflow that could be used to analyze future whitefly genomes.,This study is the first to characterize the landscape of TEs within the B. tabaci whitefly species complex. The characterization of these elements within the three whitefly genomes shows that TEs occupy significant portions of B. tabaci genomes, with DNA transposons representing the vast majority.

As agents of genetic disruption, a TE’s potential to impact phenotype is partially a factor of its location in the genome. Previous research has shown TEs’ ability to impact the expression of neighboring genes, however our understanding of this trend is hampered by the exceptional amount of diversity in the TE world, and a lack of publicly available computational methods that quantify the presence of TEs relative to genes.,Here, we have developed a tool to more easily quantify TE presence relative to genes through the use of only a gene and TE annotation, yielding a new metric we call TE Density. Briefly defined as the proportion of TE-occupied base-pairs relative to a window-size of the genome. This new pipeline reports TE density for each gene in the genome, for each type descriptor of TE (order and superfamily), and for multiple positions and distances relative to the gene (upstream, intragenic, and downstream) over sliding, user-defined windows. In this way, we overcome previous limitations to the study of TE-gene relationships by focusing on all TE types present in the genome, utilizing flexible genomic distances for measurement, and reporting a TE presence metric for every gene in the genome.,Together, this new tool opens up new avenues for studying TE-gene relationships, genome architecture, comparative genomics, and the tremendous diversity present of the TE world.

The retrotransposition process of LINE-1 can trigger the activation of the innate immune system and has been proposed to play a role in the development of several autoimmune diseases, including Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS). In contrast, all known AGS-associated proteins, except MDA5, have been reported to affect LINE-1 activity. Thus, MDA5 is likely to also function as a LINE-1 suppressor.,MDA5 was found to potently suppress LINE-1 activity in a reporter-based LINE-1 retrotransposition assay. Although MDA5 is an endogenous RNA sensor able to activate the innate immune system, increased interferon (IFN) expression only contributed in part to MDA5-mediated LINE-1 suppression. Instead, MDA5 potently regulated the promoter activity of LINE-1 5′-UTR, as confirmed by transiently expressed myc-tagged MDA5 or knockdown of endogenous MDA5 expression. Consequently, MDA5 effectively reduced the generation of LINE-1 RNA and the subsequent expression of LINE-1 ORF1p and ORF2p. Interestingly, despite MDA5 being a multi-domain protein, the N-terminal 2CARD domain alone is sufficient to interact with LINE-1 5′-UTR and inhibit LINE-1 promoter activity.,Our data reveal that MDA5 functions as a promoter regulator; it directly binds to the LINE-1 5′-UTR and suppresses its promoter activity. Consequently, MDA5 reduces LINE-1 RNA and protein levels, and ultimately inhibits LINE-1 retrotransposition. In contrast, MDA5-induced IFN expression only plays a mild role in MDA5-mediated LINE-1 suppression. In addition, the N-terminal 2CARD domain was found to be a functional region for MDA5 upon inhibition of LINE-1 replication. Thus, our data suggest that besides being an initiator of the innate immune system, MDA5 is also an effector against LINE-1 activity, potentially forming a feedback loop by suppressing LINE-1-induced innate immune activation.","12 April 2022","LINE-1,MDA5,Retrotransposition,5′-UTR,Promoter regulation","xu_w@jlu.edu.cn,zhaoke@jlu.edu.cn","Wei Xu or Ke Zhao."

It primarily concerned the genomes of species belonging to clades in the base of large taxonomic groups whose genomes, to a certain extent, can preserve relict and/or possesses specific traits. Thus, we sought to investigate the genomes of Chenopodium (Amaranthaceae, Caryophyllales) species to unravel the structural variability of CACTA elements. Caryophyllales is a separate branch of Angiosperms and until recently the diversity of CACTA elements in this clade was unknown.,Application of the short-read genome assembly algorithm followed by analysis of detected complete CACTA elements allowed for the determination of their structural diversity in the genomes of 22 Chenopodium album aggregate species. This approach yielded knowledge regarding: (i) the coexistence of two CACTA transposons subtypes in single genome; (ii) gaining of additional protein conserved domains within the coding sequence; (iii) the presence of captured gene fragments, including key genes for flower development; and (iv)) identification of captured satDNA arrays. Wide comparative database analysis revealed that identified events are scattered through Angiosperms in different proportions.,Our study demonstrated that while preserving the basic element structure a wide range of coding and non-coding additions to CACTA transposons occur in the genomes of C. album aggregate species.

Murat Eren","Since the first discovery of reverse transcriptase in bacteria, and later in archaea, bacterial and archaeal retroelements have been defined by their common enzyme that coordinates diverse functions. Yet, evolutionary refinement has produced distinct retroelements across the tree of microbial life that are perhaps best described in terms of their programmed RNA—a compact sequence that preserves core information for a sophisticated mechanism. From this perspective, reverse transcriptase has been selected as the modular tool for carrying out nature’s instructions in various RNA templates. Beneficial retroelements—those that can provide a fitness advantage to their host—evolved to their extant forms in a wide array of microorganisms and their viruses, spanning nearly all habitats. Within each specialized retroelement class, several universal features seem to be shared across diverse taxa, while specific functional and mechanistic insights are based on only a few model retroelement systems from clinical isolates. Currently, little is known about the diversity of cellular functions and ecological significance of retroelements across different biomes. With increasing availability of isolate, metagenome-assembled, and single-amplified genomes, the taxonomic and functional breadth of prokaryotic retroelements is coming into clearer view. This review explores the recently characterized classes of beneficial, yet accessory retroelements of bacteria and archaea. We describe how these specialized mechanisms exploit a form of fixed mobility, whereby the retroelements do not appear to proliferate selfishly throughout the genome. Moreover, we discuss computational approaches for systematic identification of retroelements from vast sequence repositories and highlight recent discoveries in terms of their apparent distribution and ecological significance in nature. Lastly, we present a new perspective on the eco-evolutionary significance of these genetic elements in marine bacteria and demonstrate approaches that enable the characterization of their environmental diversity through metagenomics.","23 February 2022","","bgpaul@mbl.edu,meren@mbl.edu","Blair G.

A high-quality chromosomal genome assembly is available for the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), but it lacks an in-depth transposable element (TE) annotation, presenting an opportunity to explore monarch TE dynamics and the impact of TEs on shaping the monarch genome.,We find 6.21% of the monarch genome is comprised of TEs, a reduction of 6.85% compared to the original TE annotation performed on the draft genome assembly. Monarch TE content is low compared to two closely related species with available genomes, Danaus chrysippus (33.97% TE) and Danaus melanippus (11.87% TE). The biggest TE contributions to genome size in the monarch are LINEs and Penelope-like elements, and three newly identified families, r2-hero_dPle (LINE), penelope-1_dPle (Penelope-like), and hase2-1_dPle (SINE), collectively contribute 34.92% of total TE content. We find evidence of recent TE activity, with two novel Tc1 families rapidly expanding over recent timescales (tc1-1_dPle, tc1-2_dPle). LINE fragments show signatures of genomic deletions indicating a high rate of TE turnover. We investigate associations between TEs and wing colouration and immune genes and identify a three-fold increase in TE content around immune genes compared to other host genes.,We provide a detailed TE annotation and analysis for the monarch genome, revealing a considerably smaller TE contribution to genome content compared to two closely related Danaus species with available genome assemblies.

The underlying common mechanistic feature of all IS6 family members which have been investigated is that they appear to transpose by replicative transposition and form pseudo compound transposons with the flanking IS in direct repeat and in which associated genes are simply transferred to the target replicon and lost from the donor.,In the accompanying letter Hall raises a number of very serious and wide-ranging criticisms of our recent review article concerning the IS6 family of insertion sequences. She clearly feels that we have undervalued her work and that we question or ignore certain of her in vivo results. This impression is almost certainly the result of the standard of proof we generally apply to mechanistic aspects of transposition where we think it important to identify transposition intermediates including the types of synaptic, strand cleavage and strand transfer complexes involved.","03 January 2022","","mc2126@georgetown.edu","Michael Chandler."
"59","Comment on “the IS6 family, a clinically important group of insertion sequences including IS26” by Varani and co-authors","Ruth M. Hall","The insertion sequence IS26 has long been known to play a major role in the recruitment of antibiotic resistance genes into the mobile resistance gene pool of Gram-negative bacteria and IS26 also plays a major role in their subsequent broad dissemination. Related IS, IS431/257 and IS1216 are important in the same roles in Gram positive bacteria. However, until recently the properties of IS26 movement that could potentially explain this ability had not been explored. A much needed insight has come from our recent demonstration that IS26 uses a novel targeted mechanism that is conservative. The targeted conservative mechanism is much more efficient than the known replicative mechanism, which is now more accurately called copy-in. A recent review “The IS6 family, a clinically important group of insertion sequences including IS26” by Varani, He, Siguier, Ross and Chandler published in Mobile DNA has substantially misrepresented the recent studies on the targeted conservative mechanism and at the same time incorrectly implied that any mechanism established for IS26 can be assumed to apply to a range of IS that are at best very distantly related. A few of the most important issues are examined in this comment. Readers are advised to consult the original literature to check facts before drawing firm conclusions.","03 January 2022","IS26 family,Insertion sequence IS26

We report 86,154 polymorphic retrotransposon insertions—including > 60% not previously reported—and 158 de novo retrotransposition events. The overall burden of de novo events was similar between ASD individuals and unaffected siblings, with 1 de novo insertion per 29, 117, and 206 births for Alu, L1, and SVA respectively, and 1 de novo insertion per 21 births total. However, ASD cases showed more de novo L1 insertions than expected in ASD genes. Additionally, we observed exonic insertions in loss-of-function intolerant genes, including a likely pathogenic exonic insertion in CSDE1, only in ASD individuals.,These findings suggest a modest, but important, impact of intronic and exonic retrotransposon insertions in ASD, show the importance of WGS for their analysis, and highlight the utility of specific bioinformatic tools for high-throughput detection of retrotransposon insertions.","27 November 2021","Transposable elements,Retrotransposons,Autism spectrum disorder,de novo insertions,Polymorphic insertions,de novo rates,Alu,SVA,LINE-1,Neurobiology","Christopher.Walsh@childrens.harvard.edu,ealice.lee@childrens.harvard.edu","Christopher A.

Kapitonov and Maria A. Nilsson","The majority of structural variation in genomes is caused by insertions of transposable elements (TEs). In mammalian genomes, the main TE fraction is made up of autonomous and non-autonomous non-LTR retrotransposons commonly known as LINEs and SINEs (Long and Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements). Here we present one of the first population-level analysis of TE insertions in a non-model organism, the giraffe. Giraffes are ruminant artiodactyls, one of the few mammalian groups with genomes that are colonized by putatively active LINEs of two different clades of non-LTR retrotransposons, namely the LINE1 and RTE/BovB LINEs as well as their associated SINEs. We analyzed TE insertions of both types, and their associated SINEs in three giraffe genome assemblies, as well as across a population level sampling of 48 individuals covering all extant giraffe species.,The comparative genome screen identified 139,525 recent LINE1 and RTE insertions in the sampled giraffe population. The analysis revealed a drastically reduced RTE activity in giraffes, whereas LINE1 is still actively propagating in the genomes of extant (sub)-species. In concert with the extremely low activity of the giraffe RTE, we also found that RTE-dependent SINEs, namely Bov-tA and Bov-A2, have been virtually immobile in the last 2 million years. Despite the high current activity of the giraffe LINE1, we did not find evidence for the presence of currently active LINE1-dependent SINEs. TE insertion heterozygosity rates differ among the different (sub)-species, likely due to divergent population histories.,The horizontally transferred RTE/BovB and its derived SINEs appear to be close to inactivation and subsequent extinction in the genomes of extant giraffe species. This is the first time that the decline of a TE family has been meticulously analyzed from a population genetics perspective. Our study shows how detailed information about past and present TE activity can be obtained by analyzing large-scale population-level genomic data sets.","26 November 2021","Giraffe,Ruminantia,Structural variation,Genome,Transposable elements,TE,Non-LTR retrotransposons,LINE,SINE,LINE1/L1,RTE,BovB","maria.nilsson-janke@senckenberg.de","Maria A.

The evolution of L1 retrotransposition rates and its implications for L1 dynamics are poorly understood. Retrotransposition rates are commonly measured in cell culture-based assays, but it is unclear how well these measurements provide insight into L1 population dynamics. This study applied comparative methods to estimate parameters for the evolution of retrotransposition rates, and infer L1 dynamics from these estimates.,Our results show that the rates at which new L1s emerge in the human population correlate positively to cell-culture based retrotransposition activities, that there is an evolutionary trend towards lower retrotransposition activity, and that this evolutionary trend is not sufficient to counter-balance the increase in active L1s resulting from continuing retrotransposition.,Together, these findings support a model of the population-level L1 retrotransposition dynamics that is consistent with prior expectations and indicate the remaining gaps in the understanding of L1 dynamics in human genomes.","15 November 2021","","hb54@aub.edu.lb","Heinrich zu Dohna."

The purpose of this study is to functionally characterize the attB in S. pneumoniae strains with different genetic backgrounds and in other bacterial species, and to investigate the presence of Tn5253 attB site into bacterial genomes.,Analysis of representative Tn5253-carryng transconjugants obtained in S. pneumoniae strains with different genetic backgrounds and in other bacterial species, namely Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Enterococcus faecalis showed that: (i) Tn5253 integrates in rbgA of S. pneumoniae and in orthologous rbgA genes of other bacterial species, (ii) integration occurs always downstream of a 11-bp sequence conserved among streptococcal and enterococcal hosts, (iii) length of the attB site corresponds to length of the duplication after Tn5253 integration, (iv) attB duplication restores rbgA CDS, (v) Tn5253 produced circular forms containing the attTn site at a concentration ranging between 2.0 × 10−5 to 1.2 × 10−2 copies per chromosome depending on bacterial species and strain, (vi) reconstitution of attB sites occurred at 3.7 × 10−5 to 1.7 × 10−2 copies per chromosome.

However, genomic analyses often remain too limited in number and diversity of species investigated to study in depth the dynamics and evolutionary success of the different types of TEs among metazoans. Therefore, we chose to investigate the use of transcriptomes to describe the diversity of TEs in phylogenetically related species by conducting the first comparative analysis of TEs in two groups of polychaetes and evaluate the diversity of TEs that might impact genomic evolution as a result of their mobility.,We present a detailed analysis of TEs distribution in transcriptomes extracted from 15 polychaetes depending on the number of reads used during assembly, and also compare these results with additional TE scans on associated low-coverage genomes. We then characterized the clades defined by 1021 LTR-retrotransposon families identified in 26 species. Clade richness was highly dependent on the considered superfamily. Copia elements appear rare and are equally distributed in only three clades, GalEa, Hydra and CoMol. Among the eight BEL/Pao clades identified in annelids, two small clades within the Sailor lineage are new for science. We characterized 17 Gypsy clades of which only 4 are new; the C-clade largely dominates with a quarter of the families. Finally, all species also expressed for the majority two distinct transcripts encoding PIWI proteins, known to be involved in control of TEs mobilities.,This study shows that the use of transcriptomes assembled from 40 million reads was sufficient to access to the diversity and proportion of the transposable elements compared to those obtained by low coverage sequencing. Among LTR-retrotransposons Gypsy elements were unequivocally dominant but results suggest that the number of Gypsy clades, although high, may be more limited than previously thought in metazoans. For BEL/Pao elements, the organization of clades within the Sailor lineage appears more difficult to establish clearly. The Copia elements remain rare and result from the evolutionary consistent success of the same three clades.","29 October 2021","Transposable elements,LTR-retrotransposons,Polychaetous annelids,Transcriptoms,PIWI proteins","ebonnivard@sb-roscoff.fr","Eric Bonnivard."

Successful SG organogenesis is the product of highly controlled and orchestrated genetic and transcriptional programs. Mounting evidence links Transposable Elements (TEs), originally thought to be selfish genetic elements, to different aspects of gene regulation in mammalian development and disease. To our knowledge, the role of TEs during murine SG organogenesis has not been studied. Using novel bioinformatic tools and publicly available RNA-Seq datasets, our results indicate that a significant number of genic and intergenic TEs are differentially expressed during the SG development. Furthermore, changes in expression of specific TEs correlated with that of genes involved in cellular division and differentiation, critical aspects for SG maturation. Altogether, we propose that TEs modulate gene networks that operate during SG development.","22 October 2021","Submandibular gland,Transposable elements,Gene regulation,Organogenesis,Development","mocarrasco@utalca.cl,juantapia@utalca.cl","Mónica Carrasco or Juan Carlos Tapia."

In particular, diverse ancient and archaic human genome sequences are increasingly available, allowing reconstruction of past human migration events and holding the promise of identifying and tracking TEs among other evolutionarily important genetic variants at an unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. However, highly degraded short DNA templates and other unique challenges presented by ancient human DNA call for major changes in current experimental and computational procedures to enable the identification of evolutionarily important TEs. Ancient human genomes are valuable resources for investigating TEs in the evolutionary context, and efforts to explore ancient human genomes will potentially provide a novel perspective on the genetic mechanism of human brain evolution and inspire a variety of technological and methodological advances. In this review, we summarize computational and experimental approaches that can be adapted to identify and validate evolutionarily important TEs, especially for human brain evolution.

Throughout human evolution, around 500,000 LINE-1 sequences have accumulated in the genome. Most of these sequences belong to ancestral LINE-1 subfamilies, including L1PA2-L1PA7, and can no longer mobilize. Only a small fraction of LINE-1 sequences, approximately 80 to 100 copies belonging to the L1Hs subfamily, are complete and still capable of retrotransposition. While silenced in most cells, many questions remain regarding LINE-1 dysregulation in cancer cells.,Here, we optimized CRISPR Cas9 gRNAs to specifically target the regulatory sequence of the L1Hs 5’UTR promoter. We identified three gRNAs that were more specific to L1Hs, with limited binding to older LINE-1 sequences (L1PA2-L1PA7). We also adapted the C-BERST method (dCas9-APEX2 Biotinylation at genomic Elements by Restricted Spatial Tagging) to identify LINE-1 transcriptional regulators in cancer cells.

Associations of the TLR genes polymorphisms with disease susceptibility, which are the basis of molecular breeding for disease resistant animals, have been reported extensively. Retrotransposon insertion polymorphisms (RIPs), as a new type of molecular markers developed recently, have great potential in population genetics and quantitative trait locus mapping. In this study, bioinformatic prediction combined with PCR-based amplification was employed to screen for RIPs in porcine TLR genes. Their population distribution was examined, and for one RIP the impact on gene activity and phenotype was further evaluated.,Five RIPs, located at the 3' flank of TLR3, 5' flank of TLR5, intron 1 of TLR6, intron 1 of TLR7, and 3' flank of TLR8 respectively, were identified. These RIPs were detected in different breeds with an uneven distribution among them. By using the dual luciferase activity assay a 192 bp endogenous retrovirus (ERV) in the intron 1 of TLR6 was shown to act as an enhancer increasing the activities of TLR6 putative promoter and two mini-promoters. Furthermore, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis revealed significant association (p < 0.05) of the ERV insertion with increased mRNA expression of TLR6, the neighboring gene TLR1, and genes downstream in the TLR signaling pathway such as MyD88 (Myeloid differentiation factor 88), Rac1 (Rac family small GTPase 1), TIRAP (TIR domain containing adaptor protein), Tollip (Toll interacting protein) as well as the inflammatory factors IL6 (Interleukin 6), IL8 (Interleukin 8), and TNFα (Tumor necrosis factor alpha) in tissues of 30 day-old piglet. In addition, serum IL6 and TNFα concentrations were also significantly upregulated by the ERV insertion (p < 0.05).,A total of five RIPs were identified in five different TLR loci. The 192 bp ERV insertion in the first intron of TLR6 was associated with higher expression of TLR6, TLR1, and several genes downstream in the signaling cascade. Thus, the ERV insertion may act as an enhancer affecting regulation of the TLR signaling pathways, and can be potentially applied in breeding of disease resistant animals.","18 August 2021","Pig,Retrotransposon,RIP,ERV,

Over 65 % of pig SINE RIPs overlap with genes, most of them (> 95 %) are in introns. Overall, about one forth (23.09 %) of the total genes contain SINE RIPs. Significant biases of SINE RIPs in the transcripts of protein coding genes were observed. Nearly half of the RIPs are common in these pig breeds. Sixteen SINE RIPs were applied for population genetic analysis in 23 pig breeds, the phylogeny tree and cluster analysis were generally consistent with the geographical distributions of native pig breeds in China.,Our analysis revealed that SINEA1–3 elements, particularly SINEA1, are high polymorphic across different pig breeds, and generate large-scale structural variations in the pig genomes. And over 35,000 SINE RIP markers were obtained. These data indicate that young SINE elements play important roles in creating new genetic variations and shaping the evolution of pig genome, and also provide strong evidences to support the great potential of SINE RIPs as genetic markers, which can be used for population genetic analysis and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in pig.","28 June 2021","Retrotransposon,Insertion polymorphism,RIP,SINE,Pig,Molecular marker","cysong@yzu.edu.cn","Chengyi Song."

Although their RNA abundance can be evaluated by Northern blotting and primer extension, the nature (sequence, exact length, and genomic origin) of these RNAs cannot be revealed by these methods. Moreover, mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) is not able to distinguish bona fide SINE RNAs or SINE sequences present in longer transcripts.,To elucidate the abundance, source loci, and sequence nature of SINE RNAs, we established a deep sequencing method, designated as melRNA-seq (medium-length RNA-seq), which can determine whole-length RNA sequences. Total RNA samples were treated with 5′ pyrophosphohydrolase (RppH), which allowed ligation of an RNA adaptor to the 5′ end of intact SINE RNAs. Similarly, another adaptor was ligated to the 3′ end, followed by reverse transcription, PCR amplification, size selection, and single-end deep sequencing. The analysis of two biological replicates of RNAs from mouse spermatogonia showed high reproducibility of SINE expression data both at family and locus levels.,This new method can be used for quantification and detailed sequence analysis of medium-length non-coding RNAs, such as rRNA, snRNA, tRNAs, and SINE RNAs.

"74","The derepression of transposable elements in lung cells is associated with the inflammatory response and gene activation in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis","Mahboubeh R. Rostami and Martina Bradic","Transposable elements (TEs) are repetitive sequences of viral origin that compose almost half of the human genome. These elements are tightly controlled within cells, and if activated, they can cause changes in both gene regulation and immune viral responses that have been associated with several chronic inflammatory diseases in humans. As oxidants are potent activators of TEs, and because oxidative injury is a major risk factor in relation to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), we hypothesized that TEs might be involved in the regulation of gene expression and so contribute to inflammation in cases of IPF. IPF is a fatal lung disease that involves the gradual replacement of the alveolar tissue with fibrotic scars as well as the accumulation of inflammatory cells in the lower respiratory tract. Although IPF is known to occur as a result of the complex interaction between age, environmental risk factors (i.e., oxidative stress) and genetics, the relative contributions of these factors to the disease remain unclear. To determine whether TEs are associated with IPF, we compared the transcriptional profiles of the genes and TEs of lung cells obtained from both healthy donors and IPF patients.,We quantified TE and gene expression levels using a published bulk RNA-seq dataset containing 24 subjects (16 donors and eight IPF patients), including three lung-cell types per subject, as well as an scRNA-seq dataset concerning 16 subjects (eight donors and eight IPF patients).,We found evidence of TE dysregulation in the alveolar type II lung cells and alveolar macrophages of the IPF patients. In addition, the activation of the LINE1 family of elements in IPF is associated with the increased expression of TE cellular regulators (MOV10, IFI16, SAMHD1, and APOBECG3), interferon-stimulating genes (ISG15, IFI6, IFI27, IFI44, and OAS1), chemokines (CX3CL1 and CXCL9), and interleukins (IL15RA). We also propose that TE derepression might be involved in the regulation of previously reported IPF candidate genes (MUC5B, CHL1, SPP1, and MMP7).,Based on our findings, we propose that TE derepression plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression and can also prompt both the recruitment of inflammatory processes and the disruption of the immunological balance, which can lead to chronic inflammation in IPF.","09 June 2021","","bradicm@mskcc.org","Martina Bradic."

In the well-characterized E. coli transposon Tn7, a heteromeric TnsA-TnsB transposase directs cut-and-paste transposition by cleaving both strands at each transposon end during the excision step. Whether a similar pathway is involved for RNA-guided transposons, in which CRISPR-Cas systems confer DNA target specificity, has not been determined. Here, we apply long-read, population-based whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to unambiguously resolve transposition products for two evolutionarily distinct transposon types that employ either Cascade or Cas12k for RNA-guided DNA integration. Our results show that RNA-guided transposon systems lacking functional TnsA primarily undergo copy-and-paste transposition, generating cointegrate products that comprise duplicated transposon copies and genomic insertion of the vector backbone. Finally, we report natural and engineered transposon variants encoding a TnsAB fusion protein, revealing a novel strategy for achieving RNA-guided transposition with fewer molecular components.","08 June 2021","CRISPR-Cas,RNA-guided transposase,Tn7,Transposition,SMRT-seq,CAST","shsternberg@gmail.com","Samuel H.

DNA transposon-encoded transposases bind to the ends of their cognate transposons and catalyze their movement. In some cases, exaptation of transposon genes has allowed novel cellular functions to emerge. The PiggyMac (Pgm) endonuclease of the ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia is a domesticated transposase from the PiggyBac family. It carries a core catalytic domain typical of PiggyBac-related transposases and a short cysteine-rich domain (CRD), flanked by N- and C-terminal extensions. During sexual processes Pgm catalyzes programmed genome rearrangements (PGR) that eliminate ~ 30% of germline DNA from the somatic genome at each generation. How Pgm recognizes its DNA cleavage sites in chromatin is unclear and the structure-function relationships of its different domains have remained elusive.,We provide insight into Pgm structure by determining the fold adopted by its CRD, an essential domain required for PGR. Using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, we show that the Pgm CRD binds two Zn2+ ions and forms an unusual binuclear cross-brace zinc finger, with a circularly permutated treble-clef fold flanked by two flexible arms. The Pgm CRD structure clearly differs from that of several other PiggyBac-related transposases, among which is the well-studied PB transposase from Trichoplusia ni. Instead, the arrangement of cysteines and histidines in the primary sequence of the Pgm CRD resembles that of active transposases from piggyBac-like elements found in other species and of human PiggyBac-derived domesticated transposases. We show that, unlike the PB CRD, the Pgm CRD does not bind DNA. Instead, it interacts weakly with the N-terminus of histone H3, whatever its lysine methylation state.,The present study points to the structural diversity of the CRD among transposases from the PiggyBac family and their domesticated derivatives, and highlights the diverse interactions this domain may establish with chromatin, from sequence-specific DNA binding to contacts with histone tails. Our data suggest that the Pgm CRD fold, whose unusual arrangement of cysteines and histidines is found in all PiggyBac-related domesticated transposases from Paramecium and Tetrahymena, was already present in the ancestral active transposase that gave rise to ciliate domesticated proteins.","29 April 2021","Domesticated transposase,Zinc finger structure,Genome rearrangements,Ciliates,Histones","mireille.betermier@i2bc.paris-saclay.fr,nelly.morellet@cnrs.fr","Mireille Bétermier or Nelly Morellet."

Two IS, IS26 (found in many enterobacterial clinical isolates as components of both chromosome and plasmids) and IS257 (identified in the plasmids and chromosomes of gram-positive bacteria), have received particular attention for their clinical impact. Although few biochemical data are available concerning the transposition mechanism of these elements, genetic studies have provided some interesting observations suggesting that members of the family might transpose using an unexpected mechanism. In this review, we present an overview of the family, the distribution and phylogenetic relationships of its members, their impact on their host genomes and analyse available data concerning the particular transposition pathways they may use. We also provide a mechanistic model that explains the recent observations on one of the IS6 family transposition pathways: targeted cointegrate formation between replicons.","23 March 2021","Insertion sequence,Phylogeny,Genome impact,Transposition mechanisms,Clinical importance,Antibiotic resistance","Mc2126@georgetown.edu","Michael Chandler."

Schiraldi, Reza Nemati, Dan Fabris, Marlene Belfort and Olga Novikova","Group II introns are mobile retroelements, capable of invading new sites in DNA. They are self-splicing ribozymes that complex with an intron-encoded protein to form a ribonucleoprotein that targets DNA after splicing. These molecules can invade DNA site-specifically, through a process known as retrohoming, or can invade ectopic sites through retrotransposition. Retrotransposition, in particular, can be strongly influenced by both environmental and cellular factors.,To investigate host factors that influence retrotransposition, we performed random insertional mutagenesis using the ISS1 transposon to generate a library of over 1000 mutants in Lactococcus lactis, the native host of the Ll.LtrB group II intron. By screening this library, we identified 92 mutants with increased retrotransposition frequencies (RTP-ups). We found that mutations in amino acid transport and metabolism tended to have increased retrotransposition frequencies. We further explored a subset of these RTP-up mutants, the most striking of which is a mutant in the ribosomal RNA methyltransferase rlmH, which exhibited a reproducible 20-fold increase in retrotransposition frequency. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that ribosomes in the rlmH mutant were defective in the m3Ψ modification and exhibited reduced binding to the intron RNA.,Taken together, our results reinforce the importance of the native host organism in regulating group II intron retrotransposition. In particular, the evidence from the rlmH mutant suggests a role for ribosome modification in limiting rampant retrotransposition.","07 March 2021","Mobile genetic elements,Retrotransposons,Ribosomes,RNA splicing","mbelfort@albany.edu,novikoos@buffalostate.edu","Marlene Belfort or Olga Novikova."

They function as both ribozymes and retroelements. Group IIC introns are the only class reported so far to be associated with integrons. In order to identify group II introns linked with integrons and CALINS (cluster of attC sites lacking a neighboring integron integrase) within halophiles, we mined for integrons in 28 assembled metagenomes from hypersaline environments and publically available 104 halophilic genomes using Integron Finder followed by blast search for group II intron reverse transcriptases (RT)s.,We report the presence of different group II introns associated with integrons and integron-related sequences denoted by UHB.F1, UHB.I2, H.ha.F1 and H.ha.F2. The first two were identified within putative integrons in the metagenome of Tanatar-5 hypersaline soda lake, belonging to IIC and IIB intron classes, respectively at which the first was a truncated intron. Other truncated introns H.ha.F1 and H.ha.F2 were also detected in a CALIN within the extreme halophile Halorhodospira halochloris, both belonging to group IIB introns. The intron-encoded proteins (IEP) s identified within group IIB introns belonged to different classes: CL1 class in UHB.I2 and bacterial class E in H.ha.Fa1 and H.ha.F2. A newly identified insertion sequence (ISHahl1) of IS200/605 superfamily was also identified adjacent to H. halochloris CALIN. Finally, an abundance of toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems was observed within the identified integrons.,So far, this is the first investigation of group II introns within integrons in halophilic genomes and metagenomes from hypersaline environments. We report the presence of group IIB introns associated with integrons or CALINs.

Although some elements were reported to be induced by various abiotic or biotic factors, there is a lack of general understanding on how environment influences the activity and diversity of TEs. Here, we combined common garden experiment with short-read sequencing to investigate genomic abundance and expression of 2245 consensus TE sequences (containing retrotransposons and DNA transposons) in an alpine environment in Arabidopsis arenosa. To disentangle general trends from local differentiation, we leveraged four foothill-alpine population pairs from different mountain regions. Seeds of each of the eight populations were raised under four treatments that differed in temperature and irradiance, two factors varying with elevation. RNA-seq analysis was performed on leaves of young plants to test for the effect of elevation and subsequently of temperature and irradiance on expression of TE sequences.,Genomic abundance of the 2245 consensus TE sequences varied greatly between the mountain regions in line with neutral divergence among the regions, representing distinct genetic lineages of A. arenosa. Accounting for intraspecific variation in abundance, we found consistent transcriptomic response for some TE sequences across the different pairs of foothill-alpine populations suggesting parallelism in TE expression. In particular expression of retrotransposon LTR Copia (e.g. Ivana and Ale clades) and LTR Gypsy (e.g. Athila and CRM clades) but also non-LTR LINE or DNA transposon TIR MuDR consistently varied with elevation of origin. TE sequences responding specifically to temperature and irradiance belonged to the same classes as well as additional TE clades containing potentially stress-responsive elements (e.g. LTR Copia Sire and Tar, LTR Gypsy Reina).,Our study demonstrated that the A. arenosa genome harbours a considerable diversity of TE sequences whose abundance and expression response varies across its native range. Some TE clades may contain transcriptionally active elements responding to a natural environmental gradient. This may further contribute to genetic variation between populations and may ultimately provide new regulatory mechanisms to face environmental challenges.","27 February 2021","Alpine environment,

We previously identified a genome-wide repertoire of candidate intracisternal A particle (IAP) TEs in mice that exhibit inter-individual variability in this methylation (VM-IAPs) with implications for genome function.,Here we validate these metastable epialleles and discover a novel class that exhibit tissue specificity (tsVM-IAPs) in addition to those with uniform methylation in all tissues (constitutive- or cVM-IAPs); both types have the potential to regulate genes in cis. Screening for variable methylation at other TEs shows that this phenomenon is largely limited to IAPs, which are amongst the youngest and most active endogenous retroviruses. We identify sequences enriched within cVM-IAPs, but determine that these are not sufficient to confer epigenetic variability. CTCF is enriched at VM-IAPs with binding inversely correlated with DNA methylation. We uncover dynamic physical interactions between cVM-IAPs with low methylation ranges and other genomic loci, suggesting that VM-IAPs have the potential for long-range regulation.,Our findings indicate that a recently evolved interplay between genetic sequence, CTCF binding, and DNA methylation at young TEs can result in inter-individual variability in transcriptional outcomes with implications for phenotypic variation.","21 February 2021","Retrotransposon,Endogenous retrovirus,Intracisternal A particle,DNA methylation,Metastable epiallele,CTCF,Chromatin conformation","afsmith@gen.cam.ac.uk","Anne C.

The LINE-1 bicistronic mRNA codes for two proteins, ORF1p, a nucleic acid chaperone, and ORF2p, a protein with endonuclease and reverse transcriptase activity. Both proteins bind LINE-1 mRNA in cis and are necessary for retrotransposition. While LINE-1 transcription is usually repressed in most healthy somatic cells through a plethora of mechanisms, ORF1p expression has been observed in nearly 50% of tumors, and new LINE-1 insertions have been documented in a similar fraction of tumors, including prostate cancer.,Here, we utilized RNA ImmunoPrecipitation (RIP) and the L1EM analysis software to identify ORF1p bound RNA in prostate cancer cells. We identified LINE-1 loci that were expressed in parental androgen sensitive and androgen independent clonal derivatives. In all androgen independent cells, we found higher levels of LINE-1 RNA, as well as unique expression patterns of LINE-1 loci. Interestingly, we observed that ORF1p bound many non-LINE-1 mRNA in all prostate cancer cell lines evaluated, and polyA RNA, and RNA localized in p-bodies were especially enriched. Furthermore, the expression levels of RNAs identified in our ORF1p RIP correlated with RNAs expressed in LINE-1 positive tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).,Our results show a significant remodeling of LINE-1 loci expression in androgen independent cell lines when compared to parental androgen dependent cells. Additionally, we found that ORF1p bound a significant amount of non-LINE-1 mRNA, and that the enriched ORF1p bound mRNAs are also amplified in LINE-1 expressing TCGA prostate tumors, indicating the biological relevance of our findings to prostate cancer.","09 February 2021","LINE-1,L1EM,ORF1p,Prostate cancer,Processing bodies,RNA,Retrotransposition","Susan.Logan@nyulangone.org,David@FenyoLab.org","Susan K.

We evaluate the reliability of annotation with common subfamilies by assessing the extent to which subfamily annotation is reproducible in replicate copies created by segmental duplications in the human genome, and in homologous copies shared by human and chimpanzee.,We find that standard methods annotate over 10% of replicates as belonging to different subfamilies, despite the fact that they are expected to be annotated as belonging to the same subfamily. Point mutations and homologous recombination appear to be responsible for some of this discordant annotation (particularly in the young Alu family), but are unlikely to fully explain the annotation unreliability.,The surprisingly high level of disagreement in subfamily annotation of homologous sequences highlights a need for further research into definition of TE subfamilies, methods for representing subfamily annotation confidence of TE instances, and approaches to better utilizing such nuanced annotation data in downstream analysis.","23 January 2021","Transposable elements,Interspersed repeats,Subfamilies,Segmental duplications","travis.wheeler@umontana.edu","Travis J.

By controlling length and genomic distributions, we observed that satellite, long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), and DNA transposons were each specifically enriched for R-loops in humans, fruit flies, and Arabidopsis thaliana, respectively. R-loops also tended to arise in regions of low-complexity or simple repeats across species. We also found that the repetitive elements associated with R-loop formation differ according to developmental stage. For instance, LINEs and long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTRs) are more likely to contain R-loops in embryos (fruit fly) and then turn out to be low-complexity and simple repeats in post-developmental S2 cells.,Our results indicate that repetitive elements may have species-specific or development-specific regulatory effects on R-loop formation.

TE sequence exaptation constitutes an important source of novelties for gene, genome and organism evolution, giving rise to new regulatory sequences, protein-coding exons/genes and non-coding RNAs, which can play various roles beneficial to the host. In this review, we focus on the development of vertebrates, which present many derived traits such as bones, adaptive immunity and a complex brain.

Mamedov","Retroelements (REs) occupy a significant part of all eukaryotic genomes including humans. The majority of retroelements in the human genome are inactive and unable to retrotranspose. Dozens of active copies are repressed in most normal tissues by various cellular mechanisms. These copies can become active in normal germline and brain tissues or in cancer, leading to new retroposition events. The consequences of such events and their role in normal cell functioning and carcinogenesis are not yet fully understood. If new insertions occur in a small portion of cells they can be found only with the use of specific methods based on RE enrichment and high-throughput sequencing. The downside of the high sensitivity of such methods is the presence of various artifacts imitating real insertions, which in many cases cannot be validated due to lack of the initial template DNA. For this reason, adequate assessment of rare (< 1%) subclonal cancer specific RE insertions is complicated.,Here we describe a new copy-capture technique which we implemented in a method called SeqURE for Sequencing Unknown of Retroposition Events that allows for efficient and reliable identification of new genomic RE insertions. The method is based on the capture of copies of target molecules (copy-capture), selective amplification and sequencing of genomic regions adjacent to active RE insertions from both sides. Importantly, the template genomic DNA remains intact and can be used for validation experiments. In addition, we applied a novel system for testing method sensitivity and precisely showed the ability of the developed method to reliably detect insertions present in 1 out of 100 cells and a substantial portion of insertions present in 1 out of 1000 cells. Using advantages of the method we showed the absence of somatic Alu insertions in colorectal cancer samples bearing tumor-specific L1HS insertions.,This study presents the first description and implementation of the copy-capture technique and provides the first methodological basis for the quantitative assessment of RE insertions present in a small portion of cells.","14 December 2020","Retroelements,Human genome,Insertional polymorphism,Copy capture,High-throughput sequencing","alexandrkomkov@yandex.ru,imamedov@mx.ibch.ru","Alexander Y.

ITs exhibited a narrow taxonomic distribution pattern in the animal kingdom, with invasions into two invertebrate phyla (Arthropoda and Cnidaria) and three vertebrate lineages (Actinopterygii, Agnatha, and Anura): very similar to that of the DD36E/IC family. Some animal orders and species seem to be more hospitable to Tc1/mariner transposons, one order of Amphibia and seven Actinopterygian orders are the most common orders with horizontal transfer events and have been invaded by all four families (DD38E/IT, DD35E/TR, DD36E/IC and DD37E/TRT) of Tc1/mariner transposons, and eight Actinopterygii species were identified as the major hosts of these families. Intact ITs have a total length of 1.5–1.7 kb containing a transposase gene flanked by terminal inverted repeats (TIRs). The phylogenetic tree and sequence identity showed that IT transposases were most closely related to DD34E/Tc1. ITs have been involved in multiple events of horizontal transfer in vertebrates and have invaded most lineages recently (< 5 million years ago) based on insertion age analysis. Accordingly, ITs presented high average sequence identity (86–95%) across most vertebrate species, suggesting that some are putatively active. ITs can transpose in human HeLa cells, and the transposition efficiency of consensus TIRs was higher than that of the TIRs of natural isolates.,We conclude that DD38E/IT originated from DD34E/Tc1 and can be detected in two invertebrate phyla (Arthropoda and Cnidaria), and in three vertebrate lineages (Actinopterygii, Agnatha and Anura). IT has experienced multiple HT events in animals, dominated by recent amplifications in most species and has high identity among vertebrate taxa. Our reconstructed IT transposon vector designed according to the sequence from the “cat” genome showed high cut-and-paste activity. The data suggest that IT has been acquired recently and is active in many species.

A large proportion of ERVs lose their open reading frames (ORFs), while others retain them and become exapted by the host species. However, it remains unclear what proportion of ERVs possess ORFs (ERV-ORFs), become transcribed, and serve as candidates for co-opted genes.,We investigated characteristics of 176,401 ERV-ORFs containing retroviral-like protein domains (gag, pro, pol, and env) in 19 mammalian genomes. The fractions of ERVs possessing ORFs were overall small (~ 0.15%) although they varied depending on domain types as well as species. The observed divergence of ERV-ORF from their consensus sequences showed bimodal distributions, suggesting that a large proportion of ERV-ORFs either recently, or anciently, inserted themselves into mammalian genomes. Alternatively, very few ERVs lacking ORFs were found to exhibit similar divergence patterns. To identify candidates for ERV-derived genes, we estimated the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS) for ERV-ORFs in human and non-human mammalian pairs, and found that approximately 42% of the ERV-ORFs showed dN/dS < 1. Further, using functional genomics data including transcriptome sequencing, we determined that approximately 9.7% of these selected ERV-ORFs exhibited transcriptional potential.,These results suggest that purifying selection operates on a certain portion of ERV-ORFs, some of which may correspond to uncharacterized functional genes hidden within mammalian genomes. Together, our analyses suggest that more ERV-ORFs may be co-opted in a host-species specific manner than we currently know, which are likely to have contributed to mammalian evolution and diversification.","17 September 2020","Endogenous retrovirus,Retroviral-like protein domain,Open reading frame,Evolution,Divergence pattern,Co-option,de novo gene","so@tokai.ac.jp","So Nakagawa."

The pogo superfamily represents high diversity with six distinct families (Passer, Tigger, pogoR, Lemi, Mover, and Fot/Fot-like) and wide distribution with an expansion spanning across all the kingdoms of eukaryotes. It shows widespread occurrences in animals and fungi, but restricted taxonomic distribution in land plants. It has invaded almost all lineages of animals—even mammals—and has been domesticated repeatedly in vertebrates, with 12 genes, including centromere-associated protein B (CENPB), CENPB DNA-binding domain containing 1 (CENPBD1), Jrk helix–turn–helix protein (JRK), JRK like (JRKL), pogo transposable element derived with KRAB domain (POGK), and with ZNF domain (POGZ), and Tigger transposable element-derived 2 to 7 (TIGD2–7), deduced as originating from this superfamily. Two of them (JRKL and TIGD2) seem to have been co-domesticated, and the others represent independent domestication events. Four genes (TIGD3, TIGD4, TIGD5, and POGZ) tend to represent ancient domestications in vertebrates, while the others only emerge in mammals and seem to be domesticated recently. Significant structural variations including target site duplication (TSD) types and the DDE triad signatures (DD29–56D) were observed for pogo transposons. Most domesticated genes are derived from the complete transposase genes; but CENPB, POGK, and POGZ are chimeric genes fused with additional functional domains.,This is the first report to systematically reveal the evolutionary profiles of the pogo transposons, suggesting that pogo and Tc1/Mariner are two separate superfamilies of ITm group, and demonstrating the repeated domestications of pogo in vertebrates.

"95","LINE-1 ORF1p does not determine substrate preference for human/orangutan SVA and gibbon LAVA","Annette Damert","Non-autonomous VNTR (Variable Number of Tandem Repeats) composite retrotransposons – SVA (SINE-R-VNTR-Alu) and LAVA (L1-Alu-VNTR-Alu) – are specific to hominoid primates. SVA expanded in great apes, LAVA in gibbon. Both SVA and LAVA have been shown to be mobilized by the autonomous LINE-1 (L1)-encoded protein machinery in a cell-based assay in trans. The efficiency of human SVA retrotransposition in vitro has, however, been considerably lower than would be expected based on recent pedigree-based in vivo estimates. The VNTR composite elements across hominoids – gibbon LAVA, orangutan SVA_A descendants and hominine SVA_D descendants – display characteristic structures of the 5′ Alu-like domain and the VNTR. Different partner L1 subfamilies are currently active in each of the lineages. The possibility that the lineage-specific types of VNTR composites evolved in response to evolutionary changes in their autonomous partners, particularly in the nucleic acid binding L1 ORF1-encoded protein, has not been addressed.,Here I report the identification and functional characterization of a highly active human SVA element using an improved mneo retrotransposition reporter cassette. The modified cassette (mneoM) minimizes splicing between the VNTR of human SVAs and the neomycin phosphotransferase stop codon. SVA deletion analysis provides evidence that key elements determining its mobilization efficiency reside in the VNTR and 5′ hexameric repeats. Simultaneous removal of the 5′ hexameric repeats and part of the VNTR has an additive negative effect on mobilization rates. Taking advantage of the modified reporter cassette that facilitates robust cross-species comparison of SVA/LAVA retrotransposition, I show that the ORF1-encoded proteins of the L1 subfamilies currently active in gibbon, orangutan and human do not display substrate preference for gibbon LAVA versus orangutan SVA versus human SVA. Finally, I demonstrate that an orangutan-derived ORF1p supports only limited retrotransposition of SVA/LAVA in trans, despite being fully functional in L1 mobilization in cis.,Overall, the analysis confirms SVA as a highly active human retrotransposon and preferred substrate of the L1-encoded protein machinery. Based on the results obtained in human cells coevolution of L1 ORF1p and VNTR composites does not appear very likely. The changes in orangutan L1 ORF1p that markedly reduce its mobilization capacity in trans might explain the different SVA insertion rates in the orangutan and hominine lineages, respectively.","11 July 2020","","adamert@dpz.eu","Annette Damert."
"96","Deep sequencing reveals new roles for MuB in transposition immunity and target-capture, and redefines the insular Ter region of E. coli","David M. Walker and Rasika M. Harshey","The target capture protein MuB is responsible for the high efficiency of phage Mu transposition within the E. coli genome. However, some targets are off-limits, such as regions immediately outside the Mu ends (cis-immunity) as well as the entire ~ 37 kb genome of Mu (Mu genome immunity). Paradoxically, MuB is responsible for cis-immunity and is also implicated in Mu genome immunity, but via different mechanisms. This study was undertaken to dissect the role of MuB in target choice in vivo.,We tracked Mu transposition from six different starting locations on the E. coli genome, in the presence and absence of MuB. The data reveal that Mu’s ability to sample the entire genome during a single hop in a clonal population is independent of MuB, and that MuB is responsible for cis-immunity, plays a minor role in Mu genome immunity, and facilitates insertions into transcriptionally active regions. Unexpectedly, transposition patterns in the absence of MuB have helped extend the boundaries of the insular Ter segment of the E. coli genome.,The results in this study demonstrate unambiguously the operation of two distinct mechanisms of Mu target immunity, only one of which is wholly dependent on MuB. The study also reveals several interesting and hitherto unknown aspects of Mu target choice in vivo, particularly the role of MuB in facilitating the capture of promoter and translation start site targets, likely by displacing macromolecular complexes engaged in gene expression. So also, MuB facilitates transposition into the restricted Ter region of the genome.","09 July 2020","","rasika@austin.utexas.edu","Rasika M. Harshey."
"97","IS982 and kin: new insights into an old IS family","Nancy Fayad, Mireille Kallassy Awad and Jacques Mahillon","Insertion sequences (IS) are ubiquitous transposable elements with a very simple organization: two inverted repeats flanking a transposase coding gene. IS982 is one of 26 insertion sequence families known so far. With 70 registered members in the ISFinder database, this family remains somewhat unexplored, despite the association of many of its members with important features such as antibiotic resistance. IS982 has a fairly simple organization with a mean length of ca. 1 Kb, two inverted repeats with conserved 5′ AC 3′ ends flanking a transposase coding gene and direct repeats of variable lengths. Its transposase has a RNAse-H like chemistry with an atypical DDE motif.,In this study, we first highlight the current knowledge on the IS982 family by dissecting its registered members and their characteristics. Secondly, we bring new insights into this old, yet uncharted IS family, by exploring its registered elements, as well as the genomic and proteomic databases of bacterial and archaeal strains. This probing showed that the presence and distribution of this family goes far beyond the clear-cut registry of ISFinder database.","04 July 2020","Antibiotic resistance,Archaea,DDE motif,Insertion sequences,Transposase","jacques.mahillon@uclouvain.be","Jacques Mahillon."

In chickens, endogenous Avian Leukosis Virus subgroup E (ALVE) expression has been associated with reductions in muscle growth rate and egg production, as well as providing the potential for novel recombinant viruses. However, ALVEs can remain in commercial stock due to their incomplete identification and association with desirable traits, such as ALVE21 and slow feathering. The availability of whole genome sequencing (WGS) data facilitates high-throughput identification and characterisation of these retroviral remnants.,We have developed obsERVer, a new bioinformatic ERV identification pipeline which can identify ALVEs in WGS data without further sequencing. With this pipeline, 20 ALVEs were identified across eight elite layer lines from Hy-Line International, including four novel integrations and characterisation of a fast feathered phenotypic revertant that still contained ALVE21. These bioinformatically detected sites were subsequently validated using new high-throughput KASP assays, which showed that obsERVer was highly precise and exhibited a 0% false discovery rate. A further fifty-seven diverse chicken WGS datasets were analysed for their ALVE content, identifying a total of 322 integration sites, over 80% of which were novel. Like exogenous ALV, ALVEs show site preference for proximity to protein-coding genes, but also exhibit signs of selection against deleterious integrations within genes.,obsERVer is a highly precise and broadly applicable pipeline for identifying retroviral integrations in WGS data. ALVE identification in commercial layers has aided development of high-throughput diagnostic assays which will aid ALVE management, with the aim to eventually eradicate ALVEs from high performance lines. Analysis of non-commercial chicken datasets with obsERVer has revealed broad ALVE diversity and facilitates the study of the biological effects of these ERVs in wild and domesticated populations.","30 June 2020","ALVE,Ev gene,Avian Leukosis virus,Endogenous retrovirus,obsERVer,Chicken","andrew.mason@york.ac.uk","Andrew S.

However, the evolution and diversity of the Tc1/mariner superfamily remains poorly understood. Following recent developments in genome sequencing and the availability of a wealth of new genomes, Tc1/mariner TEs have been identified in many new taxa across the eukaryotic tree of life. To date, the majority of studies focussing on Tc1/mariner elements have considered only a single host lineage or just a small number of host lineages. Thus, much remains to be learnt about the evolution of Tc1/mariner TEs by performing analyses that consider elements that originate from across host diversity.,We mined the non-redundant database of NCBI using BLASTp searches, with transposase sequences from a diverse set of reference Tc1/mariner elements as queries. A total of 5158 Tc1/mariner elements were retrieved and used to reconstruct evolutionary relationships within the superfamily. The resulting phylogeny is well resolved and includes several new groups of Tc1/mariner elements. In particular, we identify a new family of plant-genome restricted Tc1/mariner elements, which we call PlantMar. We also show that the pogo family is much larger and more diverse than previously appreciated, and we review evidence for a potential revision of its status to become a separate superfamily.,Our study provides an overview of Tc1-mariner phylogeny and summarises the impressive diversity of Tc1-mariner TEs among sequenced eukaryotes. Tc1/mariner TEs are successful in a wide range of eukaryotes, especially unikonts (the taxonomic supergroup containing Amoebozoa, Opisthokonta, Breviatea, and Apusomonadida). In particular, ecdysozoa, and especially arthropods, emerge as important hosts for Tc1/mariner elements (except the PlantMar family). Meanwhile, the pogo family, which is by far the largest Tc1/mariner family, also includes many elements from fungal and chordate genomes. Moreover, there is evidence of the repeated exaptation of pogo elements in vertebrates, including humans, in addition to the well-known example of CENP-B. Collectively, our findings provide a considerable advancement in understanding of Tc1/mariner elements, and more generally they suggest that much work remains to improve understanding of the diversity and evolution of DNA TEs.","29 June 2020","Transposase,DNA transposon,Transposable element,Evolution,Phylogeny,

These relationships have a crucial effect on genome structure, function and evolution. Here, we report a novel case of mutual relationships between TEs and satDNA. In the genomes of Chenopodium s. str. species, the deletion derivatives of tnp2 conserved domain of the newly discovered CACTA-like TE Jozin are involved in generating monomers of the most abundant satDNA family of the Chenopodium satellitome. The analysis of the relative positions of satDNA and different TEs utilizing assembled Illumina reads revealed several associations between satDNA arrays and the transposases of putative CACTA-like elements when an ~ 40 bp fragment of tnp2 served as the start monomer of the satDNA array. The high degree of identity of the consensus satDNA monomers of the investigated species and the tnp2 fragment (from 82.1 to 94.9%) provides evidence of the genesis of CficCl-61-40 satDNA family monomers from analogous regions of their respective parental elements. The results were confirmed via molecular genetic methods and Oxford Nanopore sequencing. The discovered phenomenon leads to the continuous replenishment of species genomes with new identical satDNA monomers, which in turn may increase species satellitomes similarity.","26 June 2020","CACTA transposons,Satellite DNA,Transposase,

Although not all microsporidian genomes are small (size range from about 2 to 50 MB), it is suggested that the size of their genomes has been streamlined by natural selection. We explore the hypothesis that vertical transmission in microsporidia produces population bottlenecks, and thus reduces the effectiveness of natural selection. Here we compare the transposable element (TE) content of 47 microsporidian genomes, and show that genome size is positively correlated with the amount of TEs, and that species that experience vertical transmission have larger genomes with higher proportion of TEs. Our findings are consistent with earlier studies inferring that nonadaptive processes play an important role in microsporidian evolution.","23 June 2020","","karen.haag@ufrgs.br","Karen Luisa Haag."
"103","Hagfish genome reveals parallel evolution of 7SL RNA-derived SINEs","Kenji K. Kojima","Short interspersed elements (SINEs) are ubiquitous components of eukaryotic genomes. SINEs are composite transposable elements that are mobilized by non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons, also called long interspersed elements (LINEs). The 3′ part of SINEs usually originated from that of counterpart non-LTR retrotransposons. The 5′ part of SINEs mostly originated from small RNA genes. SINE1 is a group of SINEs whose 5′ part originated from 7SL RNA, and is represented by primate Alu and murine B1. Well-defined SINE1 has been found only from Euarchontoglires, a group of mammals, in contrast to the wide distribution of SINE2, which has a tRNA-derived sequence, from animals to plants to protists. Both Alu and B1 are mobilized by L1-type non-LTR retrotransposons, which are the only lineage of autonomous non-LTR retrotransposons active in these mammalian lineages.,Here a new lineage of SINE1 is characterized from the seashore hagfish Eptatretus burgeri genome. This SINE1 family, designated SINE1-1_EBu, is young, and is transposed by RTE-type non-LTR retrotransposon, not L1-type. Comparison with other SINE families from hagfish indicated the birth of SINE1-1_EBu through chimera formation of a 7SL RNA-derived sequence and an older tRNA-derived SINE family. It reveals parallel evolution of SINE1 in two vertebrate lineages with different autonomous non-LTR retrotransposon partners. The comparison between two SINE1 lineages supports that the RNA secondary structure of the Alu domain of 7SL RNA is required for the efficient retrotransposition.,The hagfish SINE1 is the first evident SINE1 family found outside of Euarchontoglires. Independent evolution of SINE1 with similar RNA secondary structure originated in 7SL RNA indicates the functional importance of 7SL RNA-derived sequence in the proliferation of SINEs.","22 May 2020","","kojima@girinst.org","Kenji K.

Petrescu and David G. Schatz","V(D) J recombination is essential for adaptive immunity in jawed vertebrates and is initiated by the RAG1-RAG2 endonuclease. The RAG1 and RAG2 genes are thought to have evolved from a RAGL (RAG-like) transposon containing convergently-oriented RAG1-like (RAG1L) and RAG2-like (RAG2L) genes. Elements resembling this presumptive evolutionary precursor have thus far only been detected convincingly in deuterostomes, leading to the model that the RAGL transposon first appeared in an early deuterostome.,We have identified numerous RAGL transposons in the genomes of protostomes, including oysters and mussels (phylum Mollusca) and a ribbon worm (phylum Nemertea), and in the genomes of several cnidarians. Phylogenetic analyses are consistent with vertical evolution of RAGL transposons within the Bilateria clade and with its presence in the bilaterian ancestor. Many of the RAGL transposons identified in protostomes are intact elements containing convergently oriented RAG1L and RAG2L genes flanked by terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) and target site duplications with striking similarities with the corresponding elements in deuterostomes. In addition, protostome genomes contain numerous intact RAG1L-RAG2L adjacent gene pairs that lack detectable flanking TIRs. Domains and critical active site and structural amino acids needed for endonuclease and transposase activity are present and conserved in many of the predicted RAG1L and RAG2L proteins encoded in protostome genomes.,Active RAGL transposons were present in multiple protostome lineages and many were likely transmitted vertically during protostome evolution. It appears that RAGL transposons were broadly active during bilaterian evolution, undergoing multiple duplication and loss/fossilization events, with the RAGL genes that persist in present day protostomes perhaps constituting both active RAGL transposons and domesticated RAGL genes. Our findings raise the possibility that the RAGL transposon arose earlier in evolution than previously thought, either in an early bilaterian or prior to the divergence of bilaterians and non-bilaterians, and alter our understanding of the evolutionary history of this important group of transposons.","06 May 2020","Recombination activating genes,RAG,Evolution,Transposon,Adaptive immunity,Transposon molecular domestication","pierre.pontarotti@univ-amu.fr,andrei.petrescu@biochim.ro,david.schatz@yale.edu","Pierre Pontarotti, Andrei J.

I summarize TE content and distribution in four well-characterized yeast model systems in this review: the pathogens Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans, and the nonpathogenic species Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. I compare and contrast their TE landscapes to their lifecycles, genomic features, as well as the presence and nature of RNA interference pathways in each species to highlight the valuable diversity represented by these models for functional studies of TEs. I then review the regulation and impacts of the Ty1 and Ty3 retrotransposons from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Tf1 and Tf2 retrotransposons from Schizosaccharomyces pombe to emphasize parallels and distinctions between these well-studied elements. I propose that further characterization of TEs in the pathogenic yeasts would enable this set of four yeast species to become an excellent set of models for comparative functional studies to address outstanding questions about TE-host relationships.","21 April 2020","

Academ superfamily of DNA transposons is one of the least characterized DNA transposon superfamilies in eukaryotes. DNA transposons belonging to the Academ superfamily have been reported from various animals, one red algal species Chondrus crispus, and one fungal species Puccinia graminis. Six Academ families from P. graminis encode a helicase in addition to putative transposase, while some other families encode a single protein which contains a putative transposase and an XPG nuclease.,Systematic searches on Repbase and BLAST searches against publicly available genome sequences revealed that several species of fungi and animals contain multiple Academ transposon families encoding a helicase. These AcademH families generate 9 or 10-bp target site duplications (TSDs) while Academ families lacking helicase generate 3 or 4-bp TSDs. Phylogenetic analysis clearly shows two lineages inside of Academ, designated here as AcademH and AcademX for encoding helicase or XPG nuclease, respectively. One sublineage of AcademH in animals encodes plant homeodomain (PHD) finger in its transposase, and its remnants are found in several fish genomes.,The AcademH lineage of TEs is widely distributed in animals and fungi, and originated early in the evolution of Academ DNA transposons.

Ruggiero and Stéphane Boissinot","Non-LTR retrotransposons often exhibit base composition that is markedly different from the nucleotide content of their host’s gene. For instance, the mammalian L1 element is AT-rich with a strong A bias on the positive strand, which results in a reduced transcription. It is plausible that the A-richness of mammalian L1 is a self-regulatory mechanism reflecting a trade-off between transposition efficiency and the deleterious effect of L1 on its host. We examined if the A-richness of L1 is a general feature of non-LTR retrotransposons or if different clades of elements have evolved different nucleotide content. We also investigated if elements belonging to the same clade evolved towards different base composition in different genomes or if elements from different clades evolved towards similar base composition in the same genome.,We found that non-LTR retrotransposons differ in base composition among clades within the same host but also that elements belonging to the same clade differ in base composition among hosts. We showed that nucleotide content remains constant within the same host over extended period of evolutionary time, despite mutational patterns that should drive nucleotide content away from the observed base composition.,Our results suggest that base composition is evolving under selection and may be reflective of the long-term co-evolution between non-LTR retrotransposons and their host. Finally, the coexistence of elements with drastically different base composition suggests that these elements may be using different strategies to persist and multiply in the genome of their host.","07 April 2020","Base composition,Codon usage,Retrotransposons,LINE,Vertebrate","sb5272@nyu.edu","Stéphane Boissinot."

However repeat elements pose several unique challenges to current bioinformatic analyses and visualization tools, as short repeat sequences can map to multiple genomic loci resulting in their misclassification and misinterpretation. In fact, sequence data mapping to repeat elements are often discarded from analysis pipelines. Therefore, there is a continued need for standardized tools and techniques to interpret genomic data of repeats.,We present the UCSC Repeat Browser, which consists of a complete set of human repeat reference sequences derived from annotations made by the commonly used program RepeatMasker. The UCSC Repeat Browser also provides an alignment from the human genome to these references, uses it to map the standard human genome annotation tracks, and presents all of them as a comprehensive interface to facilitate work with repetitive elements. It also provides processed tracks of multiple publicly available datasets of particular interest to the repeat community, including ChIP-seq datasets for KRAB Zinc Finger Proteins (KZNFs) – a family of proteins known to bind and repress certain classes of repeats. We used the UCSC Repeat Browser in combination with these datasets, as well as RepeatMasker annotations in several non-human primates, to trace the independent trajectories of species-specific evolutionary battles between LINE 1 retroelements and their repressors. Furthermore, we document at https://repeatbrowser.ucsc.edu how researchers can map their own human genome annotations to these reference repeat sequences.,The UCSC Repeat Browser allows easy and intuitive visualization of genomic data on consensus repeat elements, circumventing the problem of multi-mapping, in which sequencing reads of repeat elements map to multiple locations on the human genome. By developing a reference consensus, multiple datasets and annotation tracks can easily be overlaid to reveal complex evolutionary histories of repeats in a single interactive window. Specifically, we use this approach to retrace the history of several primate specific LINE-1 families across apes, and discover several species-specific routes of evolution that correlate with the emergence and binding of KZNFs.","31 March 2020","Repeats,Retrotransposon,Genomics,Krab zinc finger proteins,Evolution","ssalama@ucsc.edu,max@soe.ucsc.edu","Sofie R.

Polymorphic mobile element insertions (pMEIs) are a major source of human genomic variation and are gaining research interest because of their involvement in gene expression regulation, genome integrity, and disease.,Building on our previous Mobile Element Scanning (ME-Scan) protocols, we developed an integrated ME-Scan protocol to identify three major active families of human mobile elements, AluYb, L1HS, and SVA. This approach selectively amplifies insertion sites of currently active retrotransposons for Illumina sequencing. By pooling the libraries together, we can identify pMEIs from all three mobile element families in one sequencing run. To demonstrate the utility of the new ME-Scan protocol, we sequenced 12 human parent-offspring trios.

In addition, we also tested the feasibility of identifying somatic insertions using the protocol.,The integrated ME-Scan protocol is a cost-effective way to identify novel pMEIs in the human genome. In addition, by developing the protocol to detect three mobile element families, we demonstrate the flexibility of the ME-Scan protocol.

Pollock","Previously, 3% of the human genome has been annotated as simple sequence repeats (SSRs), similar to the proportion annotated as protein coding. The origin of much of the genome is not well annotated, however, and some of the unidentified regions are likely to be ancient SSR-derived regions not identified by current methods. The identification of these regions is complicated because SSRs appear to evolve through complex cycles of expansion and contraction, often interrupted by mutations that alter both the repeated motif and mutation rate. We applied an empirical, kmer-based, approach to identify genome regions that are likely derived from SSRs.,The sequences flanking annotated SSRs are enriched for similar sequences and for SSRs with similar motifs, suggesting that the evolutionary remains of SSR activity abound in regions near obvious SSRs. Using our previously described P-clouds approach, we identified ‘SSR-clouds’, groups of similar kmers (or ‘oligos’) that are enriched near a training set of unbroken SSR loci, and then used the SSR-clouds to detect likely SSR-derived regions throughout the genome.,Our analysis indicates that the amount of likely SSR-derived sequence in the human genome is 6.77%, over twice as much as previous estimates, including millions of newly identified ancient SSR-derived loci. SSR-clouds identified poly-A sequences adjacent to transposable element termini in over 74% of the oldest class of Alu (roughly, AluJ), validating the sensitivity of the approach. Poly-A’s annotated by SSR-clouds also had a length distribution that was more consistent with their poly-A origins, with mean about 35 bp even in older Alus. This work demonstrates that the high sensitivity provided by SSR-Clouds improves the detection of SSR-derived regions and will enable deeper analysis of how decaying repeats contribute to genome structure.","17 February 2020","SSR,Genome structure,Repeats,Microsatellites,Tandem repeats,Genome evolution","David.Pollock@CUAnschutz.edu","David D.

Dias, Brittny Smith, Kelley Van Vaerenberghe, Ashley Howard, Casey M. Bergman and Justin P. Blumenstiel","Transposable elements (TEs) are endogenous mutagens and their harmful effects are especially evident in syndromes of hybrid dysgenesis. In Drosophila virilis, hybrid dysgenesis is a syndrome of incomplete gonadal atrophy that occurs when males with multiple active TE families fertilize females that lack active copies of the same families. This has been demonstrated to cause the transposition of paternally inherited TE families, with gonadal atrophy driven by the death of germline stem cells. Because there are abundant, active TEs in the male inducer genome, that are not present in the female reactive genome, the D. virilis syndrome serves as an excellent model for understanding the effects of hybridization between individuals with asymmetric TE profiles.,Using the D. virilis syndrome of hybrid dysgenesis as a model, we sought to determine how the landscape of germline recombination is affected by parental TE asymmetry. Using a genotyping-by-sequencing approach, we generated a high-resolution genetic map of D. virilis and show that recombination rate and TE density are negatively correlated in this species. We then contrast recombination events in the germline of dysgenic versus non-dysgenic F1 females to show that the landscape of meiotic recombination is hardly perturbed during hybrid dysgenesis. In contrast, hybrid dysgenesis in the female germline increases transmission of chromosomes with mitotic recombination. Using a de novo PacBio assembly of the D. virilis inducer genome we show that clusters of mitotic recombination events in dysgenic females are associated with genomic regions with transposons implicated in hybrid dysgenesis.,Overall, we conclude that increased mitotic recombination is likely the result of early TE activation in dysgenic progeny, but a stable landscape of meiotic recombination indicates that either transposition is ameliorated in the adult female germline or that regulation of meiotic recombination is robust to ongoing transposition. These results indicate that the effects of parental TE asymmetry on recombination are likely sensitive to the timing of transposition.","15 February 2020","

The human genome contains around 100 integrated copies (called proviruses or loci) of the HERV-K(HML-2) virus and we argue that it is important for therapy development to know which and how many of these contribute to protein expression, and how this varies across tissues. We measured relative provirus expression in HERV-K(HML-2), using enriched RNA-Seq analysis with both short- and long-read sequencing, in three Mantle Cell Lymphoma cell lines (JVM2, Granta519 and REC1). We also confirmed expression of the Env protein in two of our cell lines using Western blotting, and analysed provirus expression data from all other relevant published studies.,Firstly, in both our and other reanalysed studies, approximately 10% of the transcripts mapping to HERV-K(HML-2) came from Env-encoding proviruses. Secondly, in one cell line the majority of the protein expression appears to come from one provirus (12q14.1). Thirdly, we find a strong tissue-specific pattern of provirus expression.,A possible dependency of Env expression on a single provirus, combined with the earlier observation that this provirus is not present in all individuals and a general pattern of tissue-specific expression among proviruses, has serious implications for future HERV-K(HML-2)-targeted immunotherapy. Further research into HERV-K(HML-2) as a possible tumour-associated antigen in blood cancers requires a more targeted, proteome-based, screening protocol that will consider these polymorphisms within HERV-K(HML-2).

Within the realm of transposable elements (TEs) however, the spatial information of how genomes are folded is still only rarely integrated in experimental studies or accounted for in modelling. Whilst polymer physics is recognised as an important tool to understand the mechanisms of genome folding, in this commentary we discuss its potential applicability to aspects of TE biology. Based on recent works on the relationship between genome organisation and TE integration, we argue that existing polymer models may be extended to create a predictive framework for the study of TE integration patterns. We suggest that these models may offer orthogonal and generic insights into the integration profiles (or “topography”) of TEs across organisms. In addition, we provide simple polymer physics arguments and preliminary molecular dynamics simulations of TEs inserting into heterogeneously flexible polymers. By considering this simple model, we show how polymer folding and local flexibility may generically affect TE integration patterns. The preliminary discussion reported in this commentary is aimed to lay the foundations for a large-scale analysis of TE integration dynamics and topography as a function of the three-dimensional host genome.","04 February 2020","","davide.michieletto@ed.ac.uk","Davide Michieletto."

Caceres, Alberto Paccanaro, Laurence Game, Simona Parrinello and Anthony G. Uren","Ligation-mediated PCR protocols have diverse uses including the identification of integration sites of insertional mutagens, integrating vectors and naturally occurring mobile genetic elements. For approaches that employ NGS sequencing, the relative abundance of integrations within a complex mixture is typically determined through the use of read counts or unique fragment lengths from a ligation of sheared DNA; however, these estimates may be skewed by PCR amplification biases and saturation of sequencing coverage.,Here we describe a modification of our previous splinkerette based ligation-mediated PCR using a novel Illumina-compatible adapter design that prevents amplification of non-target DNA and incorporates unique molecular identifiers. This design reduces the number of PCR cycles required and improves relative quantitation of integration abundance for saturating sequencing coverage. By inverting the forked adapter strands from a standard orientation, the integration-genome junction can be sequenced without affecting the sequence diversity required for cluster generation on the flow cell. Replicate libraries of murine leukemia virus-infected spleen samples yielded highly reproducible quantitation of clonal integrations as well as a deep coverage of subclonal integrations. A dilution series of DNAs bearing integrations of MuLV or piggyBac transposon shows linearity of the quantitation over a range of concentrations.,Merging ligation and library generation steps can reduce total PCR amplification cycles without sacrificing coverage or fidelity. The protocol is robust enough for use in a 96 well format using an automated liquid handler and we include programs for use of a Beckman Biomek liquid handling workstation. We also include an informatics pipeline that maps reads, builds integration contigs and quantitates integration abundance using both fragment lengths and unique molecular identifiers. Suggestions for optimizing the protocol to other target DNA sequences are included. The reproducible distinction of clonal and subclonal integration sites from each other allows for analysis of populations of cells undergoing selection, such as those found in insertional mutagenesis screens.","04 February 2020","Genomics,Genetics,Mutagenesis,Retroviruses,Integration site cloning","anthony.uren@gmail.com","Anthony G.

The ERV-W group contributed to primate physiology by providing an envelope protein (Syncytin-1) that has been adopted for placenta development in hominoids. Expression of Human ERV-W (HERV-W) sequences is investigated for a pathological role in various human diseases.,We previously characterized ERV-W group genomic sequences in human and non-human Catarrhini species. We now investigated ERV-W-like sequences in the parvorder Platyrrhini, especially regarding two species with complete genome assemblies, namely marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) and squirrel monkey (Saimiri boliviensis). We identified in both species proviral sequences, annotated as ERV1–1 in respective genome assemblies, sharing high sequence similarities with Catarrhini ERV-W. A total of 130 relatively intact proviruses from the genomes of marmoset and squirrel monkey were characterized regarding their structural and evolutionarily relationships with Catarrhini ERV-W elements. Platyrrhini ERV-W sequences share several structural features with Catarrhini ERV-W elements and are closely related phylogenetically with the latter as well as with other ERV-W-related gammaretrovirus-like ERVs. The ERV-W group colonized Platyrrhini primates of both Callitrichidae and Atelidae lineages, with provirus formations having occurred mostly between 25 and 15 mya. Two LTR subgroups were associated with monophyletic proviral bodies. A pre-gag region appears to be a sequence feature common to the ERV-W group: it harbors a putative intron sequence that is missing in some ERV-W loci, holding a putative ORF as well. The presence of a long pre-gag portion was confirmed among all gammaretroviral ERV analyzed, suggesting a role in the latter biology. It is noteworthy that, contrary to Catarrhini ERV-W, there was no evidence of L1-mediated mobilization for Platyrrhini ERV-W sequences.,Our data establish that ERV-W is not exclusive to Catarrhini primates but colonized both parvorders of Simiiformes, providing further insight into the evolution of ERV-W and the colonization of primate genomes.","01 February 2020","ERV-W,Platyrrhini,Catarrhini,Primate evolution,Endogenous retrovirus,HERV phylogeny,ERV1–1,Pre-gag,5′ leader","tramon@unica.it","Enzo Tramontano."
"116","Compensating for over-production inhibition of the Hsmar1 transposon in Escherichia coli using a series of constitutive promoters","Michael Tellier and Ronald Chalmers","Transposable elements (TEs) are a diverse group of self-mobilizing DNA elements. Transposition has been exploited as a powerful tool for molecular biology and genomics. However, transposition is sometimes limited because of auto-regulatory mechanisms that presumably allow them to cohabit within their hosts without causing excessive genomic damage. The papillation assay provides a powerful visual screen for hyperactive transposases. Transposition is revealed by the activation of a promoter-less lacZ gene when the transposon integrates into a non-essential gene on the host chromosome. Transposition events are detected as small blue speckles, or papillae, on the white background of the main Escherichia coli colony.,We analysed the parameters of the papillation assay including the strength of the transposase transcriptional and translational signals. To overcome certain limitations of inducible promoters, we constructed a set of vectors based on constitutive promoters of different strengths to widen the range of transposase expression. We characterized and validated our expression vectors with Hsmar1, a member of the mariner transposon family. The highest rate of transposition was observed with the weakest promoters. We then took advantage of our approach to investigate how the level of transposition responds to selected point mutations and the effect of joining the transposase monomers into a single-chain dimer.,We generated a set of vectors to provide a wide range of transposase expression which will be useful for screening libraries of transposase mutants. The use of weak promoters should allow screening for truly hyperactive transposases rather than those that are simply resistant to auto-regulatory mechanisms, such as overproduction inhibition (OPI). We also found that mutations in the Hsmar1 dimer interface provide resistance to OPI in bacteria, which could be valuable for improving bacterial transposon mutagenesis techniques.","10 January 2020","Papillation assay,Hsmar1,Overproduction inhibition,SETMAR,Transposase,Transposable elements","michael.tellier@path.ox.ac.uk,ronald.chalmers@nottingham.ac.uk","Michael Tellier or Ronald Chalmers."

SINE insertion can give rise to genetic variants and regulate gene expression, allowing organisms to acquire new adaptive capacity. Studies on this subject have focused on the impacts of SINEs on genes. However, ecological disparities in fish have not yet been explained by SINEs.,New SINEs were isolated from Coilia nasus, which has two ecotypes—migratory and resident—that differ in their spawning and migration behaviors. The SINEs possess two structures that resemble a tRNA gene and a LINE retrotransposon tail. Comparison of olfactory tissue transcriptomes, intact SINE transcript copies were detected in only the migratory fish at the initial retrotransposition stage. The SINE DNA copy numbers were higher in the resident type than in the migratory type, while the frequency of SINE insertion was higher in the migratory type than in the resident type. Furthermore, SINE insertions can lead to new repeats of short DNA fragments in the genome, along with target site duplications. SINEs in the resident type have undergone excision via a mechanism in which predicted cleavage sites are formed by mutations, resulting in gaps that are then filled by microsatellites via microhomology-induced replication.,Notably, SINEs in the resident type have undergone strong natural selection, causing genomic heteroplasmy and driving ecological diversity of C. nasus. Our results reveal possible evolutionary mechanisms underlying the ecological diversity at the interface between SINE mobilization and organism defense.","08 January 2020","Ecotypic diversity,Retrotransposable element,Short interspersed nuclear elements,Long interspersed nuclear elements,Natural selection","wqtang@shou.edu.cn,mzhang01@uga.edu","Wenqiao Tang or Ming Zhang."

Belancio and Prescott Deininger","Retrotransposons are one of the oldest evolutionary forces shaping mammalian genomes, with the ability to mobilize from one genomic location to another. This mobilization is also a significant factor in human disease. The only autonomous human retroelement, L1, has propagated to make up 17% of the human genome, accumulating over 500,000 copies. The majority of these loci are truncated or defective with only a few reported to remain capable of retrotransposition. We have previously published a strand-specific RNA-Seq bioinformatics approach to stringently identify at the locus-specific level the few expressed full-length L1s using cytoplasmic RNA. With growing repositories of RNA-Seq data, there is potential to mine these datasets to identify and study expressed L1s at single-locus resolution, although many datasets are not strand-specific or not generated from cytoplasmic RNA.,We developed whole-cell, cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA-Seq datasets from 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells to test the influence of different preparations on the quality and effort needed to measure L1 expression. We found that there was minimal data loss in the identification of full-length expressed L1 s using whole cell, strand-specific RNA-Seq data compared to cytoplasmic, strand-specific RNA-Seq data. However, this was only possible with an increased amount of manual curation of the bioinformatics output to eliminate increased background. About half of the data was lost when the sequenced datasets were non-strand specific.,The results of these studies demonstrate that with rigorous manual curation the utilization of stranded RNA-Seq datasets allow identification of expressed L1 loci from either cytoplasmic or whole-cell RNA-Seq datasets.","06 January 2020","","pdeinin@tulane.edu","Prescott Deininger."

When expressed, LINE-1 loci produce bicistronic transcripts encoding two proteins essential for retrotransposition, ORF1p and ORF2p. Many types of human cancers are characterized by L1 promoter hypomethylation, L1 transcription, L1 ORF1p protein expression, and somatic L1 retrotransposition. ORF2p encodes the endonuclease and reverse transcriptase activities required for L1 retrotransposition. Its expression is poorly characterized in human tissues and cell lines.,We report mass spectrometry-based tumor proteome profiling studies wherein ORF2p eludes detection. To test whether ORF2p could be detected with specific reagents, we developed and validated five rabbit monoclonal antibodies with immunoreactivity for specific epitopes on the protein. These reagents readily detect ectopic ORF2p expressed from bicistronic L1 constructs. However, endogenous ORF2p is not detected in human tumor samples or cell lines by western blot, immunoprecipitation, or immunohistochemistry despite high levels of ORF1p expression. Moreover, we report endogenous ORF1p-associated interactomes, affinity isolated from colorectal cancers, wherein we similarly fail to detect ORF2p. These samples include primary tumors harboring hundreds of somatically acquired L1 insertions. The new data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD013743.,Although somatic retrotransposition provides unequivocal genetic evidence for the expression of ORF2p in human cancers, we are unable to directly measure its presence using several standard methods. Experimental systems have previously indicated an unequal stoichiometry between ORF1p and ORF2p, but in vivo, the expression of these two proteins may be more strikingly uncoupled. These findings are consistent with observations that ORF2p is not tolerable for cell growth.","31 December 2019","","david@fenyolab.org,kburns@jhmi.edu,j.p.lacava@rug.nl","David Fenyö, Kathleen H.

Their activity impacts genome architecture and gene expression and can lead to drastic phenotypic changes. Therefore, identifying TE polymorphisms is key to better understand the link between genotype and phenotype. However, most genotype-to-phenotype analyses have concentrated on single nucleotide polymorphisms as they are easier to reliable detect using short-read data. Many bioinformatic tools have been developed to identify transposon insertions from resequencing data using short reads. Nevertheless, the performance of most of these tools has been tested using simulated insertions, which do not accurately reproduce the complexity of natural insertions.,We have overcome this limitation by building a dataset of insertions from the comparison of two high-quality rice genomes, followed by extensive manual curation. This dataset contains validated insertions of two very different types of TEs, LTR-retrotransposons and MITEs. Using this dataset, we have benchmarked the sensitivity and precision of 12 commonly used tools, and our results suggest that in general their sensitivity was previously overestimated when using simulated data. Our results also show that, increasing coverage leads to a better sensitivity but with a cost in precision. Moreover, we found important differences in tool performance, with some tools performing better on a specific type of TEs. We have also used two sets of experimentally validated insertions in Drosophila and humans and show that this trend is maintained in genomes of different size and complexity.,We discuss the possible choice of tools depending on the goals of the study and show that the appropriate combination of tools could be an option for most approaches, increasing the sensitivity while maintaining a good precision.","30 December 2019","Benchmark,Transposable elements,Polymorphism,Transposon insertion,Resequencing","josep.casacuberta@cragenomica.es,raul.castanera@cragenomica.es","Josep M.

This problem is exacerbated when dealing with repetitive sequences such as transposable elements that occupy half of the mammalian genome mass. Sequenced reads coming from these regions introduce ambiguities in the mapping step. Therefore, applying dedicated parameters and algorithms has to be taken into consideration when transposable elements regulation is investigated with sequencing datasets.,Here, we used simulated reads on the mouse and human genomes to define the best parameters for aligning transposable element-derived reads on a reference genome. The efficiency of the most commonly used aligners was compared and we further evaluated how transposable element representation should be estimated using available methods. The mappability of the different transposon families in the mouse and the human genomes was calculated giving an overview into their evolution.,Based on simulated data, we provided recommendations on the alignment and the quantification steps to be performed when transposon expression or regulation is studied, and identified the limits in detecting specific young transposon families of the mouse and human genomes.

Nested LTR retrotransposons were preferentially located in the 3’UTR of other LTR retrotransposons, while coding and regulatory regions (LTRs) are not commonly targeted. Insertions displayed a weak preference for palindromes and were associated with a strong positional pattern of higher predicted nucleosome occupancy. Deviation from randomness in target site choice was also found in 13,983 non-nested plant LTR retrotransposons.,We reveal that nesting of LTR retrotransposons is not random.

"125","Nucleotide composition of transposable elements likely contributes to AT/GC compositional homogeneity of teleost fish genomes","Radka Symonová and Alexander Suh","Teleost fish genome size has been repeatedly demonstrated to positively correlate with the proportion of transposable elements (TEs). This finding might have far-reaching implications for our understanding of the evolution of nucleotide composition across vertebrates. Genomes of fish and amphibians are GC homogenous, with non-teleost gars being the single exception identified to date, whereas birds and mammals are AT/GC heterogeneous. The exact reason for this phenomenon remains controversial. Since TEs make up significant proportions of genomes and can quickly accumulate across genomes, they can potentially influence the host genome with their own GC content (GC%). However, the GC% of fish TEs has so far been neglected.,The genomic proportion of TEs indeed correlates with genome size, although not as linearly as previously shown with fewer genomes, and GC% negatively correlates with genome size in the 33 fish genome assemblies analysed here (excluding salmonids). GC% of fish TE consensus sequences positively correlates with the corresponding genomic GC% in 29 species tested. Likewise, the GC contents of the entire repetitive vs. non-repetitive genomic fractions correlate positively in 54 fish species in Ensembl. However, among these fish species, there is also a wide variation in GC% between the main groups of TEs. Class II DNA transposons, predominant TEs in fish genomes, are significantly GC-poorer than Class I retrotransposons. The AT/GC heterogeneous gar genome contains fewer Class II TEs, a situation similar to fugu with its extremely compact and also GC-enriched but AT/GC homogenous genome.,Our results reveal a previously overlooked correlation between GC% of fish genomes and their TEs. This applies to both TE consensus sequences as well as the entire repetitive genomic fraction. On the other hand, there is a wide variation in GC% across fish TE groups. These results raise the question whether GC% of TEs evolves independently of GC% of the host genome or whether it is driven by TE localization in the host genome. Answering these questions will help to understand how genomic GC% is shaped over time. Long-term accumulation of GC-poor(er) Class II DNA transposons might indeed have influenced AT/GC homogenization of fish genomes and requires further investigation.","12 December 2019","Teleost fish,Transposon,GC content,Genome evolution,Nucleotide composition","radka.symonova@gmail.com","Radka Symonová."

We systematically analysed 31 genomes of wild and cultivated Daucus carota, yielding 18.5 thousand copies of these elements, showing remarkable insertion site polymorphism. DcSto element demography differed based on the origin of the host populations, and corresponded with the four major groups of D. carota, wild European, wild Asian, eastern cultivated and western cultivated. The DcStos elements were associated with genes, and most frequently occurred in 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs). Individual families differed in their propensity to reside in particular segments of genes. Most importantly, DcSto copies in the 2 kb regions up- and downstream of genes were more frequently associated with open reading frames encoding transcription factors, suggesting their possible functional impact. More than 1.5% of all DcSto insertion sites in different host genomes contained different copies in exactly the same position, indicating the existence of insertional hotspots. The DcSto7b family was much more polymorphic than the other families in cultivated carrot. A line of evidence pointed at its activity in the course of carrot domestication, and identified Dcmar1 as an active carrot mariner element and a possible source of the transposition machinery for DcSto7b.,Stowaway MITEs have made a substantial contribution to the structural and functional variability of the carrot genome.","27 November 2019","Transposable elements,Insertional polymorphism,TE-gene association,

The objective of this study was to apply the high-throughput “poly-Detect” method to computationally determine the number of Alu insertion polymorphisms shared by T. gelada and Papio, and vice versa, by each individual Papio species and T. gelada. Secondly, we performed locus-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays on a diverse DNA panel to complement the computational data.,We identified 27,700 Alu insertions from T. gelada WGS that were also present among six Papio species, with nearly half (12,956) remaining unfixed among 12 Papio individuals. Similarly, each of the six Papio species had species-indicative Alu insertions that were also present in T. gelada. In general, P. kindae shared more insertion polymorphisms with T. gelada than did any of the other five Papio species. PCR-based genotype data provided additional support for the computational findings.,Our discovery that several thousand Alu insertion polymorphisms are shared by T. gelada and Papio baboons suggests a much more permeable reproductive barrier between the two genera then previously suspected.

ICs have a total length of about 1.2 kb, and harbor a single open reading frame encoding a ~ 346 amino acid transposase with a DD36E motif and flanked by short terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) (22–32 base pairs, bp).

All ICs in bats (Myotis lucifugus, Eptesicus fuscus, Myotis davidii, and Myotis brandtii) are present as truncated copies in these genomes, and most of them are flanked by relatively long TIRs (51–126 bp). High copy numbers of miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) derived from ICs were also identified in bat genomes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that ICs are more closely related to DD34E/Tc1 than to other families of Tc1/mariner (e.g., DD34D/mariner and DD × D/pogo), and can be classified into four distinct clusters. The host and IC phylogenies and pairwise distance comparisons between RAG1 genes and all consensus sequences of ICs support the idea that multiple episodes of horizontal transfer (HT) of ICs have occurred in vertebrates. In addition, the discovery of intact transposases, perfect TIRs and target site duplications of ICs suggests that this family may still be active in Insecta, Arachnida, frogs, and fish.,Exploring the diversity of Tc1/mariner transposons and revealing their evolutionary profiles will help provide a better understanding of the evolution of DNA transposons and their impact on genomic evolution. Here, a newly discovered family (DD36E/Incomer) of Tc1/mariner transposons is described in animals. It displays a similar structural organization and close relationship with the known DD34E/Tc1 elements, but has a relatively narrow distribution, indicating that DD36E/IC might have originated from the DD34E/Tc1 family. Our data also support the hypothesis of horizontal transfer of IC in vertebrates, even invading one lineage of mammals (bats). This study expands our understanding of the diversity of Tc1/mariner transposons and updates the classification of this superfamily.","23 November 2019","Tc1/mariner transposons,DD36E,Horizontal transfer","cysong@yzu.edu.cn","Chengyi Song."
"130","A genomic survey of transposable elements in the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta reveals selection on codon usage","Jade Southworth, C. Alastair Grace, Alan O. Marron, Nazeefa Fatima and Martin Carr","Unicellular species make up the majority of eukaryotic diversity, however most studies on transposable elements (TEs) have centred on multicellular host species. Such studies may have therefore provided a limited picture of how transposable elements evolve across eukaryotes. The choanoflagellates, as the sister group to Metazoa, are an important study group for investigating unicellular to multicellular transitions. A previous survey of the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis revealed the presence of only three families of LTR retrotransposons, all of which appeared to be active. Salpingoeca rosetta is the second choanoflagellate to have its whole genome sequenced and provides further insight into the evolution and population biology of transposable elements in the closest relative of metazoans.,Screening the genome revealed the presence of a minimum of 20 TE families. Seven of the annotated families are DNA transposons and the remaining 13 families are LTR retrotransposons. Evidence for two putative non-LTR retrotransposons was also uncovered, but full-length sequences could not be determined. Superfamily phylogenetic trees indicate that vertical inheritance and, in the case of one family, horizontal transfer have been involved in the evolution of the choanoflagellates TEs. Phylogenetic analyses of individual families highlight recent element activity in the genome, however six families did not show evidence of current transposition. The majority of families possess young insertions and the expression levels of TE genes vary by four orders of magnitude across families. In contrast to previous studies on TEs, the families present in S. rosetta show the signature of selection on codon usage, with families favouring codons that are adapted to the host translational machinery. Selection is stronger in LTR retrotransposons than DNA transposons, with highly expressed families showing stronger codon usage bias. Mutation pressure towards guanosine and cytosine also appears to contribute to TE codon usage.,S. rosetta increases the known diversity of choanoflagellate TEs and the complement further highlights the role of horizontal gene transfer from prey species in choanoflagellate genome evolution. Unlike previously studied TEs, the S. rosetta families show evidence for selection on their codon usage, which is shown to act via translational efficiency and translational accuracy.","23 November 2019","Mutation pressure,Natural selection,Opisthokonta,Optimal codons,Pol,Tnpase","M.Carr@hud.ac.uk","Martin Carr."

In this study, we investigated the occurrence of HTT events in a group of elements that, until recently, were uncommon among the HTT records in Drosophila – the Jockey elements, members of the LINE (long interspersed nuclear element) order of non-LTR (long terminal repeat) retrotransposons. The sequences of 111 Jockey families deposited in Repbase that met the criteria of the analysis were used to identify Jockey sequences in 48 genomes of Drosophilidae (genus Drosophila, subgenus Sophophora: melanogaster, obscura and willistoni groups; subgenus Drosophila: immigrans, melanica, repleta, robusta, virilis and grimshawi groups; subgenus Dorsilopha: busckii group; genus/subgenus Zaprionus and genus Scaptodrosophila).,Phylogenetic analyses revealed 72 Jockey families in 41 genomes. Combined analyses revealed 15 potential HTT events between species belonging to different genera and species groups of Drosophilidae, providing evidence for the flow of genetic material favoured by the spatio-temporal sharing of these species present in the Palaeartic or Afrotropical region.,Our results provide phylogenetic, biogeographic and temporal evidence of horizontal transfers of the Jockey elements, increase the number of rare records of HTT in specific families of LINE elements, increase the number of known occurrences of these events, and enable a broad understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of these elements and the host species.","04 November 2019","transposable elements,HTT,

They constitute a major source of genetic innovations, as they can not only rearrange genomes but also spread ready-to-use regulatory sequences able to modify host gene expression, and even can give birth to new host genes. As their evolutionary success depends on their vertical transmission, transposable elements are intrinsically linked to reproduction. In organisms with sexual reproduction, this implies that transposable elements have to manifest their transpositional activity in germ cells or their progenitors. The control of sexual development and function can be very versatile, and several studies have demonstrated the implication of transposable elements in the evolution of sex. In this review, we report the functional and evolutionary relationships between transposable elements and sexual reproduction in animals. In particular, we highlight how transposable elements can influence expression of sexual development genes, and how, reciprocally, they are tightly controlled in gonads. We also review how transposable elements contribute to the organization, expression and evolution of sexual development genes and sex chromosomes. This underscores the intricate co-evolution between host functions and transposable elements, which regularly shift from a parasitic to a domesticated status useful to the host.","03 November 2019","Transposable element,Sex determination,Sexual development and function,Germline,piRNA,Sex chromosome","phch1@biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de,magali.naville@ens-lyon.fr","Manfred Schartl or Magali Naville."

We found core TE co-expression modules consisting mainly of transposons, showing correlated expression across broad classes of TEs. Despite this co-expression within tissues, there are individual TE loci that exhibit tissue-specific expression patterns, when compared across tissues. The core TE modules were negatively correlated with other gene modules that consisted of immune response genes in interferon signaling. KRAB Zinc Finger Proteins (KZFPs) were over-represented gene members of the TE modules, showing positive correlation across multiple tissues. But we did not find overlap between TE-KZFP pairs that are co-expressed and TE-KZFP pairs that are bound in published ChIP-seq studies.,We find unexpected variation in TE derived transcripts, within and across non-tumorous tissues. We describe a broad view of the RNA state for non-tumorous tissues exhibiting higher level of TE transcripts.

Siegel and Leif Andersson","Henny feathering in chickens is determined by a dominant mutation that transforms male-specific plumage to female-like plumage. Previous studies indicated that this phenotype is caused by ectopic expression in skin of CYP19A1 encoding aromatase that converts androgens to estrogen and thereby inhibits the development of male-specific plumage. A long terminal repeat (LTR) from an uncharacterized endogenous retrovirus (ERV) insertion was found in an isoform of the CYP19A1 transcript from henny feathering chicken. However, the complete sequence and the genomic position of the insertion were not determined.,We used publicly available whole genome sequence data to determine the flanking sequences of the ERV, and then PCR amplified the entire insertion and sequenced it using Nanopore long reads and Sanger sequencing. The 7524 bp insertion contains an intact endogenous retrovirus that was not found in chickens representing 31 different breeds not showing henny feathering or in samples of the ancestral red junglefowl. The sequence shows over 99% sequence identity to the avian leukosis virus ev-1 and ev-21 strains, suggesting a recent integration. The ERV 3’LTR, containing a powerful transcriptional enhancer and core promoter with TATA box together with binding sites for EFIII and Ig/EBP inside the CYP19A1 5′ untranslated region, was detected partially in an aromatase transcript, which present a plausible explanation for ectopic expression of aromatase in non-ovarian tissues underlying the henny feathering phenotype.,We demonstrate that the henny feathering allele harbors an insertion of an intact avian leukosis virus at the 5’end of CYP19A1. The presence of this ERV showed complete concordance with the henny feathering phenotype both within a pedigree segregating for this phenotype and across breeds.","28 August 2019","Chicken,Henny feather,Aromatase,Endogenous retrovirus,ERV,LTR","landersson@cvm.tamu.edu","Leif Andersson."

Goodwin","Transposable elements (TEs) can be key drivers of evolution, but the mechanisms and scope of how they impact gene and genome function are largely unknown. Previous analyses revealed that TE-mediated gene amplifications can have variable effects on fungal genomes, from inactivation of function to production of multiple active copies. For example, a DNA methyltransferase gene in the wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici (synonym Mycosphaerella graminicola) was amplified to tens of copies, all of which were inactivated by Repeat-Induced Point mutation (RIP) including the original, resulting in loss of cytosine methylation. In another wheat pathogen, Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, a histone H3 gene was amplified to tens of copies with little evidence of RIP, leading to many potentially active copies. To further test the effects of transposon-aided gene amplifications on genome evolution and architecture, the repetitive fraction of the significantly expanded genome of the banana pathogen, Pseudocercospora fijiensis, was analyzed in greater detail.,These analyses identified a housekeeping gene, histone H3, which was captured and amplified to hundreds of copies by a hAT DNA transposon, all of which were inactivated by RIP, except for the original. In P. fijiensis the original H3 gene probably was not protected from RIP, but most likely was maintained intact due to strong purifying selection. Comparative analyses revealed that a similar event occurred in five additional genomes representing the fungal genera Cercospora, Pseudocercospora and Sphaerulina.,These results indicate that the interplay of TEs and RIP can result in different and unpredictable fates of amplified genes, with variable effects on gene and genome evolution.","27 August 2019","Fungal evolution,Genome evolution,Purifying selection,Transduplication","Steve.Goodwin@ARS.USDA.GOV","Stephen B.

Pereira, Oliver Schilling, Eckart Meese and Jens Mayer","A considerable portion of the human genome derives from retroviruses inherited over millions of years. Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are usually severely mutated, yet some coding-competent HERVs exist. The HERV-K(HML-2) group includes evolutionarily young proviruses that encode typical retroviral proteins. HERV-K(HML-2) has been implicated in various human diseases because transcription is often upregulated and some of its encoded proteins are known to affect cell biology. HERV-K(HML-2) Protease (Pro) has received little attention so far, although it is expressed in some disease contexts and other retroviral proteases are known to process cellular proteins.,We set out to identify human cellular proteins that are substrates of HERV-K(HML-2) Pro employing a modified Terminal Amine Isotopic Labeling of Substrates (TAILS) procedure. Thousands of human proteins were identified by this assay as significantly processed by HERV-K(HML-2) Pro at both acidic and neutral pH. We confirmed cleavage of a majority of selected human proteins in vitro and in co-expression experiments in vivo. Sizes of processing products observed for some of the tested proteins coincided with product sizes predicted by TAILS. Processed proteins locate to various cellular compartments and participate in diverse, often disease-relevant cellular processes. A limited number of HERV-K(HML-2) reference and non-reference loci appears capable of encoding active Pro.,Our findings from an approach combining TAILS with experimental verification of candidate proteins in vitro and in cultured cells suggest that hundreds of cellular proteins are potential substrates of HERV-K(HML-2) Pro. It is therefore conceivable that even low-level expression of HERV-K(HML-2) Pro affects levels of a diverse array of proteins and thus has a functional impact on cell biology and possible relevance for human diseases. Further studies are indicated to elucidate effects of HERV-K(HML-2) Pro expression regarding human substrate proteins, cell biology, and disease. The latter also calls for studies on expression of specific HERV-K(HML-2) loci capable of encoding active Pro. Endogenous retrovirus-encoded Pro activity may also be relevant for disease development in species other than human.","22 August 2019","HERV-K,Endogenous retrovirus,Retroviral protease,Proteolysis,Pathogenesis,Retrotransposon","jens.mayer@uniklinik-saarland.de","Jens Mayer."

Houz) genome possessing transposases that harbour nuclear export signal (NES) domain, but not any nuclear localization signal (NLS) domain. To understand the functions of NES in transposon activity, we have conducted two experiments, fluorescence and excision frequency assays in the yeast system. For this, by site-directed mutagenesis, three NES mutants were developed from each of the MLE. In the fluorescence assay, the mutants, NES-1, 2 and 3 along with the wild types (NES-0) were fused with fluorescent proteins, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) and enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) were co-transformed into yeast system. To differentiate protein localisation under the NES influence, ECFP alone was fused to wild and mutant NES domains either on N- or C-terminal and not to EYFP. Fluorescence assay revealed that blue fluorescence of ECFP was more intense than the red fluorescence of the EYFP in the yeast cell matrix. Further, ECFP had a wider localisation in the cellular matrix, but EYFP was largely located in the nucleus. The NES-1 domain was related to the comparatively high spread of ECFP, while NES-2 and NES-3 indicated a low spread, implying that NES activity on nuclear export increased when the NES is made leucine-rich, while the signalling activity was reduced when the leucine content was lowered in the NES domain. In the transposon excision assay, the mutant and wild type NES of both the Ppmar elements were integrated into an Ade2 vector, and within the Ade2 gene. Co-transformation of the vector together with non-autonomous Ppmar transposons and NES-lacking transposases was used to assess the differential excision frequencies of the mutants NES domains. In both the MLEs, NES-1 had the highest excision suppression, which was less than half of the excision frequency of the wild type. NES-2 and NES-3 elements showed, up to three times increase in transposon excision than the wild types. The results suggested that NES is an important regulator of nuclear export of transposase in Ppmar elements and the mutation of the NES domains can either increase or decrease the export signalling. We speculate that in moso bamboo, NESs regulates the transposition activity of MLEs to maintain the genome integrity.","19 August 2019","Mariner-like elements (MLEs),Nuclear export signal (NES),Transposase,Transposition activity,

The genomes of these species enclose a fraction of retrotransposons including VIPER and TATE, two poorly studied transposable elements that encode a tyrosine recombinase (YR) and were previously classified as DIRS elements. This study investigated the distribution and evolution of VIPER and TATE in kinetoplastids to understand the relationships of these elements with other retrotransposons.,We observed that VIPER and TATE have a discontinuous distribution among Trypanosomatidae, with several events of loss and degeneration occurring during a vertical transfer evolution. We were able to identify the terminal repeats of these elements for the first time, and we showed that these elements are potentially active in some species, including T. cruzi copies of VIPER. We found that VIPER and TATE are strictly related elements, which were named in this study as VIPER-like. The reverse transcriptase (RT) tree presented a low resolution, and the origin and relationships among YR groups remain uncertain. Conversely, for RH, VIPER-like grouped with Hepadnavirus, whereas for YR, VIPER-like sequences constituted two different clades that are closely allied to Crypton. Distinct topologies among RT, RH and YR trees suggest ancient rearrangements/exchanges in domains and a modular pattern of evolution with putative independent origins for each ORF.,Due to the presence of both elements in Bodo saltans, a nontrypanosomatid species, we suggested that VIPER and TATE have survived and remained active for more than 400 million years or were reactivated during the evolution of the host species. We did not find clear evidence of independent origins of VIPER-like from the other YR retroelements, supporting the maintenance of the DIRS group of retrotransposons. Nevertheless, according to phylogenetic findings and sequence structure obtained by this study and other works, we proposed separating DIRS elements into four subgroups: DIRS-like, PAT-like, Ngaro-like, and VIPER-like.","05 August 2019","Tyrosine recombinase,DIRS,Transposable elements,Phage integrase,Hepadnavirus,Retroelements","adriana.ludwig@pq.cnpq.br","Adriana Ludwig."

Despite high-resolution analyses of the Xist RNA-binding sites, specific interaction sequences are yet to be identified. Based on elusive features of the association between Xist RNA and chromatin and the possible existence of multiple low-affinity binding sites in Xist RNA, we defined short motifs (≥5 nucleotides), termed as redundant UC/TC (r-UC/TC) or AG (r-AG) motifs, which may help in the mediation of triplex formation between the lncRNAs and duplex DNA.,The study showed that r-UC motifs are densely dispersed throughout mouse and human Xist/XIST RNAs, whereas r-AG motifs are even more densely dispersed along opossum RNA-on-the-silent X (Rsx) RNA, and also along both full-length and truncated long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE-1s, L1s) of the three species. Predicted secondary structures of the lncRNAs showed that the length range of these sequence motifs available for forming triplexes was even shorter, mainly 5- to 9-nucleotides long. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) measurements and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations indicated that minimum-length motifs can reinforce the binding state by increasing the copy number of the motifs in the same RNA or DNA molecule. Further, r-AG motifs in L1s had a similar length-distribution pattern, regardless of the similarities in the length or sequence of L1s across the three species; this also applies to high-frequency mutations in r-AG motifs, which suggests convergence in L1 sequence variations.,Multiple short motifs in both RNA and duplex DNA molecules could be brought together to form triplexes with either Hoogsteen or reverse Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding, by which their associations are cooperatively enhanced. This novel triplex interaction could be involved in associations between lncRNA and chromatin in XCI, particularly at the sites of L1s. Potential binding of Xist/XIST/Rsx RNAs specifically at L1s is most likely preserved through the r-AG motifs conserved in mammalian L1s through convergence in L1 nucleotide variations and by maintaining a particular r-UC/r-AG motif ratio in each of these lncRNAs, irrespective of their poorly conserved sequences.","30 July 2019","LINE-1,Long noncoding RNA,X-chromosome inactivation,Xist RNA,XIST RNA,Rsx RNA,Hoogsteen triplex,Reverse Hoogsteen triplex,MC simulation","ymatsuno@med.niigata-u.ac.jp","Yoko Matsuno."

While some TEs have contributed novel and beneficial host functions, this review will summarize the evidence for detrimental TE activity in neurodegenerative disorders.

A proper evaluation of their evolutionary significance has been hampered by the paucity of short scale phylogenetic comparisons between closely related species. Here, we characterized the dynamics of TE accumulation at the micro-evolutionary scale by comparing two closely related plant species, Arabidopsis lyrata and A. halleri.,Joint genome annotation in these two outcrossing species confirmed that both contain two distinct populations of TEs with either ‘recent’ or ‘old’ insertion histories. Identification of rare segregating insertions suggests that diverse TE families contribute to the ongoing dynamics of TE accumulation in the two species. Orthologous TE fragments (i.e. those that have been maintained in both species), tend to be located closer to genes than those that are retained in one species only. Compared to non-orthologous TE insertions, those that are orthologous tend to produce fewer short interfering RNAs, are less heavily methylated when found within or adjacent to genes and these tend to have lower expression levels. These findings suggest that long-term retention of TE insertions reflects their frequent acquisition of adaptive roles and/or the deleterious effects of removing nearly neutral TE insertions when they are close to genes.,Our results indicate a rapid evolutionary dynamics of the TE landscape in these two outcrossing species, with an important input of a diverse set of new insertions with variable propensity to resist deletion.","17 July 2019","Transposable elements,Arabidopsis,Genome evolution,Comparative genomics","sylvain.legrand@univ-lille.fr","Sylvain Legrand."

In Drosophila ovarian somatic cells, piRNAs arise from long RNA precursors presumably processed within cytoplasmic Yb-bodies.,Here we show that the nucleo-cytoplasmic traffic of piRNA precursors encoded by the flamenco locus is subjected to a spatio-temporal regulation. Precursor RNAs first gather in a single nuclear focus, Dot COM, close to the nuclear periphery, and transit through the membrane before being delivered to the cytoplasmic Yb-bodies. Early in oogenesis, flamenco transcripts are rapidly transferred to the cytoplasm making their initial nuclear gathering in Dot COM too transient to be visualized. As oogenesis proceeds, the cytoplasmic delivery steadily decreases concomitantly with the decrease in the protein levels of Armi and Yb, two components of the Yb-bodies. Both events lead to a reduction of Yb-body assembly in late stages of oogenesis, which likely results in a drop in piRNA production.,Our findings show a spatio-temporal regulation of the piRNA biogenesis in the follicle cells of Drosophila ovaries, that involves coordinated control of both piRNA precursors and components of the piRNA processing machinery. This newly unveiled regulation establishes another level of complexity in the production of piRNAs and suggests a stage-dependent involvement of the piRNA biogenesis in the mechanism of transposable elements silencing along oogenesis.","06 July 2019","Transposable elements,Silencing,piRNAs,

Fifty-one MITE families have undergone a single round of amplification, while the other families developed from multiple amplifications. Most mulberry MITEs were inserted near genes and some could regulate gene expression through small RNAs. An analysis of transgenic plants indicated that MITE insertions can upregulate the expression of a target gene. Moreover, MITEs are frequently associated with alternative splicing events (exonizations).,The data presented herein provide insights into the generation of MITEs as well as their impact on gene regulation and evolution in mulberry.","25 June 2019","MITEs,Amplification,Gene expression,Small RNA,Alternative splicing","hejia@swu.edu.cn","Ningjia He."
"148","A mobile restriction modification system consisting of methylases on the IncA/C plasmid","Ruibai Wang, Jing Lou and Jie Li","IncA/C plasmids play important roles in the development and dissemination of multidrug resistance in bacteria. These plasmids carry three methylase genes, two of which show cytosine specificity. The effects of such a plasmid on the host methylome were observed by single-molecule, real-time (SMRT) and bisulfite sequencing in this work.,The results showed that the numbers of methylation sites on the host chromosomes were changed, as were the sequences recognized by MTase. The host chromosomes were completely remodified by the plasmid with a methylation pattern different from that of the host itself. When the three dcm genes were deleted, the transferability of the plasmid into other Vibrio cholerae and Escherichia coli strains was lost. During deletion of the dcm genes, except for the wild-type strains and the targeted deletion strains, 18.7%~ 38.5% of the clones lost the IncA/C plasmid and changed from erythromycin-, azithromycin- and tetracycline-resistant strains to strains that were sensitive to these antibiotics.,Methylation of the IncA/C plasmid was a new mobile restriction modification (RM) barrier against foreign DNA. By actively changing the host’s methylation pattern, the plasmid crossed the barrier of the host’s RM system, and this might be the simplest and most universal method by which plasmids acquire a broad host range. Elimination of plasmids by destruction of plasmid stability could be a new effective strategy to address bacterial multidrug resistance.","07 June 2019","Methylation,

However, the mechanisms of horizontal transfer (HT) and the process of gene fragment capturing of Helitrons still remain to be further clarified.,Here, we characterized a novel Helitron family discontinuously distributed in 27 out of 256 insect genomes. The most prominent characteristic of Hel1 family is its high sequence similarity among species of different insect orders. Related elements were also identified in two spiders, representing the first report of spider Helitrons. All these elements were classified into 2 families, 9 subfamilies and 35 exemplars based on our new classification criteria. Autonomous partners of Helitron were reconstructed in the genomes of three insects and one spider. Integration pattern analysis showed that majority of Hel1A elements in Papilio xuthus and Pieris rapae inserted into introns. Consistent with filler DNA model, stepwise sequence acquisition was observed in Sfru_Hel1Aa, Sfru_Hel1Ab and Sfru_Hel1Ac in Spodoptera frugiperda. Remarkably, the evidence that Prap_Hel1Aa in a Lepdidoptera insect, Pieris rapae, was derived from Cves_Hel1Aa in a parasitoid wasp, Cotesia vestalis, suggested the role of nonregular host-parasite interactions in HT of Helitrons.,We proposed a modified classification criteria of Helitrons based on the important role of the 5′-end of Helitrons in transposition, and provided evidence for stepwise sequence acquisition and recurrent HT of a novel Helitron family. Our findings of the nonregular host-parasite interactions may be more conducive to the HT of transposons.","31 May 2019","

Our understanding of the mechanisms of such events is at an early stage. The close physical relationship between a parasite and its host could facilitate horizontal transfer. To date, two studies have identified horizontal transfer of RTEs, a class of retrotransposable elements, involving parasites: ticks might act as vector for BovB between ruminants and squamates, and AviRTE was transferred between birds and parasitic nematodes.,We searched for RTEs shared between nematode and mammalian genomes. Given their physical proximity, it was necessary to detect and remove sequence contamination from the genome datasets, which would otherwise distort the signal of horizontal transfer. We developed an approach that is based on reads instead of genomic sequences to reliably detect contamination. From comparison of 43 RTEs across 197 genomes, we identified a single putative case of horizontal transfer: we detected RTE1_Sar from Sorex araneus, the common shrew, in parasitic nematodes. From the taxonomic distribution and evolutionary analysis, we show that RTE1_Sar was horizontally transferred.,We identified a new horizontal RTE transfer in host-parasite interactions, which suggests that it is not uncommon. Further, we present and provide the workflow a read-based method to distinguish between contamination and horizontal transfer.","30 May 2019","RTE,RTE1_Sar,Horizontal transposon transfer,Host-parasite interactions","jwasmuth@ucalgary.ca","James D.

Most of the sequence-specific LINEs have been reported mainly among invertebrate species and shown to retrotranspose into the specific sequences in vivo and in vitro systems. Recenlty, 28S rDNA-specific LINE R2 elements are shown to be distributed among widespread vertebrate species, but the sequence-specific retrotransposition of R2 has never been demonstrated in vertebrates.,Here we cloned a full length unit of R2 from medaka fish Oryzias latipes, named R2Ol, and engineered it to a targeted gene integration tool in zebrafish. By injecting R2Ol-encoding mRNA into zebrafish embryos, R2Ol retrotransposed precisely into the target site at high efficiency (98%) and was transmitted to the next generation at high frequency (50%). We also generated transgenic zebrafish carrying the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter gene in 28S rDNA target by the R2Ol retrotransposition system.,Sequence-specific LINE retrotransposes into the precise sequence using target primed reverse transcription (TPRT), possibly providing an alternative and effective targeted gene knockin method in vertebrates.","22 May 2019","Non-LTR retrotransposon,Long interspersed element (LINE),28S rDNA specific element R2,Sequence-specific retrotransposition,Targeted gene knockin,Transgenic zebrafish","haruh@edu.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp","Haruhiko Fujiwara."

Wichman","L1 retrotransposons have co-evolved with their mammalian hosts for the entire history of mammals and currently compose ~ 20% of a mammalian genome. B1 retrotransposons are dependent on L1 for retrotransposition and span the evolutionary history of rodents since their radiation. L1s were found to have lost their activity in a group of South American rodents, the Sigmodontinae, and B1 inactivation preceded the extinction of L1 in the same group. Consequently, a basal group of sigmodontines have active L1s but inactive B1s and a derived clade have both inactive L1s and B1s. It has been suggested that B1s became extinct during a long period of L1 quiescence and that L1s subsequently reemerged in the basal group.,Here we investigate the evolutionary histories of L1 and B1 in the sigmodontine rodents and show that L1 activity continued until after the L1-extinct clade and the basal group diverged. After the split, L1 had a small burst of activity in the former group, followed by extinction. In the basal group, activity was initially low but was followed by a dramatic increase in L1 activity. We found the last wave of B1 retrotransposition was large and probably preceded the split between the two rodent clades.,Given that L1s had been steadily retrotransposing during the time corresponding to B1 extinction and that the burst of B1 activity preceding B1 extinction was large, we conclude that B1 extinction was not a result of L1 quiescence. Rather, the burst of B1 activity may have contributed to L1 extinction both by competition with L1 and by putting strong selective pressure on the host to control retrotransposition.","21 May 2019","","hwichman@uidaho.edu","Holly A.

Belancio","Long Interspersed Element 1 (LINE-1) is a retrotransposon that is present in 500,000 copies in the human genome. Along with Alu and SVA elements, these three retrotransposons account for more than a third of the human genome sequence. These mobile elements are able to copy themselves within the genome via an RNA intermediate, a process that can promote genome instability. LINE-1 encodes two proteins, ORF1p and ORF2p. Association of ORF1p, ORF2p and a full-length L1 mRNA in a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particle, L1 RNP, is required for L1 retrotransposition. Previous studies have suggested that fusion of a tag to L1 proteins can interfere with L1 retrotransposition.,Using antibodies detecting untagged human ORF1p, western blot analysis and manipulation of ORF1 sequence and length, we have identified a set of charged amino acids in the C-terminal region of ORF1p that are important in determining its subcellular localization. Mutation of 7 non-identical lysine residues is sufficient to make the resulting ORF1p to be predominantly cytoplasmic, demonstrating intrinsic redundancy of this requirement. These residues are also necessary for ORF1p to retain its association with KPNA2 nuclear pore protein. We demonstrate that this interaction is significantly reduced by RNase treatment. Using co-IP, we have also determined that human ORF1p associates with all members of the KPNA subfamily.,The prediction of NLS sequences suggested that specific sequences within ORF1p could be responsible for its subcellular localization by interacting with nuclear binding proteins. We have found that multiple charged amino acids in the C-terminus of ORF1p are involved in ORF1 subcellular localization and interaction with KPNA2 nuclear pore protein. Our data demonstrate that different amino acids can be mutated to have the same phenotypic effect on ORF1p subcellular localization, demonstrating that the net number of charged residues or protein structure, rather than their specific location, is important for the ORF1p nuclear localization. We also identified that human ORF1p interacts with all members of the KPNA family of proteins and that multiple KPNA family genes are expressed in human cell lines.","06 May 2019","Retrotransposon,LINE-1,L1,ORF1p","vperepe@tulane.edu","V.

ERVs were classified into 18 families and found two most “modern” subfamilies in the pig genome. The transposition activity of pig L1 was verified by experiment, the sense and antisense promoter activities of young L1 5′UTRs and ERV LTRs and expression profiles of young retrotransposons in multiple tissues and cell lines were also validated. Furthermore, retrotransposons had an extensive impact on lncRNA and protein coding genes at both the genomic and transcriptomic levels. Most protein coding and lncRNA (> 80%) genes contained retrotransposon insertions, and about half of protein coding genes (44.30%) and one-fourth (24.13%) of lncRNA genes contained the youngest retrotransposon insertions. Nearly half of protein coding genes (43.78%) could generate chimeric transcripts with retrotransposons. Significant distribution bias of retrotransposon composition, location, and orientation in lncRNA and protein coding genes, and their transcripts, were observed.,In the current study, we characterized the classification and evolution profile of retrotransposons in pigs, experimentally proved the transposition activity of the young pig L1 subfamily, characterized the sense and antisense expression profiles and promoter activities of young retrotransposons, and investigated their impact on lncRNA and protein coding genes by defining the mobilome landscapes at the genomic and transcriptomic levels.

Ritchie, Gérard Guédon, Sophie Payot, Marie-Dominique Devignes and Nathalie Leblond-Bourget","Conjugative spread of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes in bacteria constitutes an important threat to public health. Beyond the well-known conjugative plasmids, recent genome analyses have shown that integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) are the most widespread conjugative elements, even if their transfer mechanism has been little studied until now. The initiator of conjugation is the relaxase, a protein catalyzing a site-specific nick on the origin of transfer (oriT) of the ICE. Besides canonical relaxases, recent studies revealed non-canonical ones, such as relaxases of the MOBT family that are related to rolling-circle replication proteins of the Rep_trans family. MOBT relaxases are encoded by ICEs of the ICESt3/ICEBs1/Tn916 superfamily, a superfamily widespread in Firmicutes, and frequently conferring antibiotic resistance.,Here, we present the first biochemical and structural characterization of a MOBT relaxase: the RelSt3 relaxase encoded by ICESt3 from Streptococcus thermophilus. We identified the oriT region of ICESt3 and demonstrated that RelSt3 is required for its conjugative transfer. The purified RelSt3 protein is a stable dimer that provides a Mn2+-dependent single-stranded endonuclease activity. Sequence comparisons of MOBT relaxases led to the identification of MOBT conserved motifs. These motifs, together with the construction of a 3D model of the relaxase domain of RelSt3, allowed us to determine conserved residues of the RelSt3 active site. The involvement of these residues in DNA nicking activity was demonstrated by targeted mutagenesis.,All together, this work argues in favor of MOBT being a full family of non-canonical relaxases. The biochemical and structural characterization of a MOBT member provides new insights on the molecular mechanism of conjugative transfer mediated by ICEs in Gram-positive bacteria. This could be a first step towards conceiving rational strategies to control gene transfer in these bacteria.","03 May 2019","Integrative and conjugative elements ,Relaxase ,MOBT,Conjugation ,Tn916 ,Firmicutes","nicolas.soler@univ-lorraine.fr,nathalie.leblond@univ-lorraine.fr","Nicolas Soler or Nathalie Leblond-Bourget."

Both penetrant (with kinky tails) and silent (without kinky tails) AxincL1 mice, regardless of sex, could transmit the phenotype to subsequent generations with similar penetrance (~ 80%). Further analyses revealed that a longer Axin1 transcript isoform containing partial cL1-targeted intron was present in penetrant, but absent in silent and wild type mice, and the production of this unique Axin1 transcript appeared to correlate with altered levels of an activating histone modification, H3K9ac.,The mechanism for AxincL1 mice is different from those previously identified in mice with spontaneous retrotransposition of IAP, e.g., AxinFu and Avy, both of which have been associated with DNA methylation changes.

Upton","Transposable elements (TE) are commonly regarded as “junk DNA” with no apparent regulatory roles in the human genome. However, a growing body of evidence demonstrates that some TEs exhibit regulatory activities in a range of biological pathways and diseases, with notable examples in bile metabolism and innate immunity. TEs are typically suppressed by epigenetic modifications in healthy somatic tissues, which prevents both undesirable effects of insertional mutagenesis, and also unwanted gene activation. Interestingly, TEs are widely reported to be dysregulated in epithelial cancers, and while much attention has been paid to their effects on genome instability, relatively little has been reported on their effects on gene regulation. Here, we investigated the contribution of TEs to the transcriptional regulation in breast cancer cell lines.,We found that a subset of TE subfamilies were enriched in oncogenic transcription factor binding sites and also harboured histone marks associated with active transcription, raising the possibility of these subfamilies playing a broad role in breast cancer transcriptional regulation. To directly assess promoter activity in triple negative breast cancer cell lines, we identified four breast cancer-associated genes with putative TE-derived promoters. TE deletion confirmed a contribution to promoter activity in all cases, and for two examples the promoter activity was almost completely contained within the TE.,Our findings demonstrate that TEs provide abundant oncogenic transcription factor binding sites in breast cancer and that individual TEs contain substantial promoter activity. Our findings provide further evidence for transcriptional regulation of human genes through TE exaptation by demonstrating the regulatory potential of TEs in multiple breast cancer cell lines.","27 April 2019","Transposable elements,Breast cancer,Transcription factor binding,Promoter,Epigenetics,Non-coding RNAs","k.upton@uq.edu.au","Kyle R.

The number of monomers varies between retrotransposon copies, thus making it difficult to annotate L1Md promoters. Duplication of monomers contributes to the maintenance of L1Md promoters during truncation-prone retrotranspositions, but the associated mechanism remains unclear. Since the current classification of monomers is based on limited data, a comprehensive monomer annotation is needed for supporting functional studies of L1Md promoters genome-wide.,We developed a pipeline for de novo monomer detection and classification. Identified monomers are further classified into subtypes based on their sequence profiles. We applied this pipeline to genome assemblies of various rodent species. A major monomer subtype of the lab mouse was also found in other Mus species, implying that such subtype has emerged in the common ancestor of involved species. We also characterized the positioning pattern of monomer subtypes within individual promoters. Our analyses indicate that the subtype composition of an L1Md promoter can be used to infer its transcriptional activity during male germ cell development.,We identified subtypes for all monomer types using comprehensive data, greatly expanding the spectrum of monomer variants. The analysis of monomer subtype positioning provides evidence supporting both previously proposed models of L1Md promoter expansion. The transcription silencing of L1Md promoters differs between promoter types, which supports a model involving distinct suppressive pathways rather than a universal mechanism for retrotransposon repression in gametogenesis.","08 April 2019","Retrotransposon,L1Md monomer,Classification,Annotation","andrewds@usc.edu","Andrew D.

Consequently, MULEs are important genetic tools and represent a key study system for research into host-transposon interactions. Yet, while several studies have focused on the impacts of MULEs on crop and fungus genomes, their evolution remains poorly explored.,We perform comprehensive bioinformatic and phylogenetic analyses to address currently available MULE diversity and reconstruct evolution for the group. For this, we mine MULEs from online databases, and combine search results with available transposase sequences retrieved from previously published studies. Our analyses uncover two entirely new MULE clades that contain elements almost entirely restricted to arthropod hosts, considerably expanding the set of MULEs known from this group, suggesting that many additional MULEs may await discovery from further arthropod genomes. In several cases, close relationships occur between MULEs recovered from distantly related host organisms, suggesting that horizontal transfer events may have played an important role in the evolution of the group. However, it is apparent that MULEs from plants remain separate from MULEs identified from other host groups. MULE structure varies considerably across phylogeny, and TIR length is shown to vary greatly both within and between MULE groups. Our phylogeny suggests that MULE diversity is clustered in well-supported groups, typically according to host taxonomy. With reference to this, we make suggestions on how MULE diversity can be partitioned to provide a robust taxonomic framework.,Our study represents a considerable advance in the understanding of MULE diversity, host range and evolution, and provides a taxonomic framework for the classification of further MULE elements that await discovery. Our findings also raise a number of questions relating to MULE biology, suggesting that this group will provide a rich avenue for future study.","21 March 2019","MULE,MULEs,MuDR,Transposon,Horizontal transmission,Horizontal transfer,Phylogenetic analysis","m.dupeyron@exeter.ac.uk,alex.hayward@exeter.ac.uk","Mathilde Dupeyron or Alexander Hayward."

We screened 218 strains collected in 15 natural populations, and we found that the CG18446 promoter region contains 20 independent roo insertions.

Moreover, we found that the roo insertional cluster in the CG18446 promoter region is unique: no other promoter region in the genome contains a similar number of roo insertions.

Currently ~ 3000 adult and ~ 30 pluripotent stem cell-based, interventional clinical trials are ongoing worldwide, and numbers are increasing continuously. Although stem cells are promising cell sources to treat a wide range of human diseases, there are also concerns regarding potential risks associated with their clinical use, including genomic instability and tumorigenesis concerns. Thus, a deeper understanding of the factors and molecular mechanisms contributing to stem cell genome stability are a prerequisite to harnessing their therapeutic potential for degenerative diseases. Chemical and physical factors are known to influence the stability of stem cell genomes, together with random mutations and Copy Number Variants (CNVs) that accumulated in cultured human stem cells. Here we review the activity of endogenous transposable elements (TEs) in human multipotent and pluripotent stem cells, and the consequences of their mobility for genomic integrity and host gene expression. We describe transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms antagonizing the spread of TEs in the human genome, and highlight those that are more prevalent in multipotent and pluripotent stem cells. Notably, TEs do not only represent a source of mutations/CNVs in genomes, but are also often harnessed as tools to engineer the stem cell genome; thus, we also describe and discuss the most widely applied transposon-based tools and highlight the most relevant areas of their biomedical applications in stem cells. Taken together, this review will contribute to the assessment of the risk that endogenous TE activity and the application of genetically engineered TEs constitute for the biosafety of stem cells to be used for substitutive and regenerative cell therapies.","09 March 2019","Adult stem cells,Genomic destabilization,LINE-1,Methylation,Pluripotent stem cells,Restriction,Regenerative medicine,Transposable elements","Gerald.Schumann@pei.de","Gerald G.

To this end, laboratories have developed strategies to selectively amplify or otherwise enrich transposable element insertion sites in genomic DNA.,Here we describe a technique, Transposon Insertion Profiling by sequencing (TIPseq), to map Long INterspersed Element 1 (LINE-1, L1) retrotransposon insertions in the human genome. This method uses vectorette PCR to amplify species-specific L1 (L1PA1) insertion sites followed by paired-end Illumina sequencing. In addition to providing a step-by-step molecular biology protocol, we offer users a guide to our pipeline for data analysis, TIPseqHunter. Our recent studies in pancreatic and ovarian cancer demonstrate the ability of TIPseq to identify invariant (fixed), polymorphic (inherited variants), as well as somatically-acquired L1 insertions that distinguish cancer genomes from a patient’s constitutional make-up.,TIPseq provides an approach for amplifying evolutionarily young, active transposable element insertion sites from genomic DNA. Our rationale and variations on this protocol may be useful to those mapping L1 and other mobile elements in complex genomes.","08 March 2019","LINE-1,Targeted PCR,Next generation sequencing","jef.boeke@nyumc.org,kburns@jhmi.edu","Jef D.

Most isolates of this pathogen contain native plasmids collectively carrying many pathogenicity and virulence genes. However, P. syringae is generally an opportunistic pathogen primarily inhabiting environmental reservoirs, which could exert a low selective pressure for virulence plasmids. Additionally, these plasmids usually contain a large proportion of repeated sequences, which could compromise plasmid integrity. Therefore, the identification of plasmid stability determinants and mechanisms to preserve virulence genes is essential to understand the evolution of this pathogen and its adaptability to agroecosystems.,The three virulence plasmids of P. syringae pv. savastanoi NCPPB 3335 contain from one to seven functional stability determinants, including three highly active toxin-antitoxin systems (TA) in both pPsv48A and pPsv48C. The TA systems reduced loss frequency of pPsv48A by two orders of magnitude, whereas one of the two replicons of pPsv48C likely confers stable inheritance by itself. Notably, inactivation of the TA systems from pPsv48C exposed the plasmid to high-frequency deletions promoted by mobile genetic elements. Thus, recombination between two copies of MITEPsy2 caused the deletion of an 8.3 kb fragment, with a frequency of 3.8 ± 0.3 × 10− 3. Likewise, one-ended transposition of IS801 generated plasmids containing deletions of variable size, with a frequency of 5.5 ± 2.1 × 10− 4, of which 80% had lost virulence gene idi. These deletion derivatives were stably maintained in the population by replication mediated by repJ, which is adjacent to IS801. IS801 also promoted deletions in plasmid pPsv48A, either by recombination or one-ended transposition. In all cases, functional TA systems contributed significantly to reduce the occurrence of plasmid deletions in vivo.,Virulence plasmids from P. syringae harbour a diverse array of stability determinants with a variable contribution to plasmid persistence. Importantly, we showed that multiple plasmid-borne TA systems have a prominent role in preserving plasmid integrity and ensuring the maintenance of virulence genes in free-living conditions. This strategy is likely widespread amongst native plasmids of P. syringae and other bacteria.","31 January 2019","Postsegregational killing,Native plasmid evolution,IS801

Their detection and annotation are considered essential in any genome sequencing project. The number of fully sequenced genomes is rapidly increasing with improvements in high-throughput sequencing technologies. A fully automated de novo annotation process for TEs is therefore required to cope with the deluge of sequence data.,However, all automated procedures are error-prone, and an automated procedure for TE identification and classification would be no exception. It is therefore crucial to provide not only the TE reference sequences, but also evidence justifying their classification, at the scale of the whole genome. A few TE databases already exist, but none provides evidence to justify TE classification. Moreover, biological information about the sequences remains globally poor.,We present here the RepetDB database developed in the framework of GnpIS, a genetic and genomic information system. RepetDB is designed to store and retrieve detected, classified and annotated TEs in a standardized manner. RepetDB is an implementation with extensions of InterMine, an open-source data warehouse framework used here to store, search, browse, analyze and compare all the data recorded for each TE reference sequence. InterMine can display diverse information for each sequence and allows simple to very complex queries. Finally, TE data are displayed via a worldwide data discovery portal. RepetDB is accessible at urgi.versailles.inra.fr/repetdb.,RepetDB is designed to be a TE knowledge base populated with full de novo TE annotations of complete (or near-complete) genome sequences.

Nilsson","Baleen whales (Mysticeti) are the largest animals on earth and their evolutionary history has been studied in detail, but some relationships still remain contentious. In particular, reconstructing the phylogenetic position of the gray whales (Eschrichtiidae) has been complicated by evolutionary processes such as gene flow and incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). Here, whole-genome sequencing data of the extant baleen whale radiation allowed us to identify transposable element (TE) insertions in order to perform phylogenomic analyses and measure germline insertion rates of TEs. Baleen whales exhibit the slowest nucleotide substitution rate among mammals, hence we additionally examined the evolutionary insertion rates of TE insertions across the genomes.,In eleven whole-genome sequences representing the extant radiation of baleen whales, we identified 91,859 CHR-SINE insertions that were used to reconstruct the phylogeny with different approaches as well as perform evolutionary network analyses and a quantification of conflicting phylogenetic signals. Our results indicate that the radiation of rorquals and gray whales might not be bifurcating. The morphologically derived gray whales are placed inside the rorqual group, as the sister-species to humpback and fin whales. Detailed investigation of TE insertion rates confirm that a mutational slow down in the whale lineage is present but less pronounced for TEs than for nucleotide substitutions.,Whole genome sequencing based detection of TE insertions showed that the speciation processes in baleen whales represent a rapid radiation. Large genome-scale TE data sets in addition allow to understand retrotransposition rates in non-model organisms and show the potential for TE calling methods to study the evolutionary history of species.","21 January 2019","Evolution,Phylogenetics,Whales,Transposable elements,Retrotransposon","maria.nilsson-janke@senckenberg.de","Maria A.

One of the most conclusive cases of HGT in metazoans was previously described for the cellulose synthase gene in ascidians.,In this study we identified a new protein, rusticalin, from the ascidian Styela rustica and presented evidence for its likely origin by HGT. Discernible homologues of rusticalin were found in placozoans, coral, and basal Chordates. Rusticalin was predicted to consist of two distinct regions, an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain. The N-terminal domain comprises two cysteine-rich repeats and shows remote similarity to the tick carboxypeptidase inhibitor. The C-terminal domain shares significant sequence similarity with bacterial MD peptidases and bacteriophage A500 L-alanyl-D-glutamate peptidase. A possible transfer of the C-terminal domain by bacteriophage was confirmed by an analysis of noncoding sequences of C. intestinalis rusticalin-like gene, which was found to contain a sequence similar to the bacteriophage A500 recombination site. Moreover, a sequence similar to the bacteriophage recombination site was found to be adjacent to the cellulose synthase catalytic subunit gene in the genome of Streptomices sp., the donor of ascidian cellulose synthase.,The C-terminal domain of rusticalin and rusticalin-like proteins is likely to be horizontally transferred by the bacteriophage A500.

Analysis of the repeat fraction benefits the understanding of genome structure and evolution. Spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.), an important vegetable crop, is also a model dioecious plant species for studying sex determination and sex chromosome evolution. However, the repetitive sequences of the spinach genome have not been fully investigated.,We extensively analyzed the repetitive components of draft spinach genome, especially TEs and satellites, by different strategies. A total of 16,002 full-length TEs were identified. Among the most abundant long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons (REs), Copia elements were overrepresented compared with Gypsy ones. Angela was the most dominating Copia lineage; Ogre/Tat was the most abundant Gypsy lineage. The mean insertion age of LTR-REs was 1.42 million years; approximately 83.7% of these elements were retrotransposed during the last two million years. RepeatMasker totally masked about 64.05% of the spinach genome, with LTR-REs, non-LTR-REs, and DNA transposons occupying 49.2, 2.4, and 5.6%, respectively. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis showed that most LTR-REs dispersed all over the chromosomes, by contrast, elements of CRM lineage were distributed at the centromeric region of all chromosomes. In addition, Ogre/Tat lineage mainly accumulated on sex chromosomes, and satellites Spsat2 and Spsat3 were exclusively located at the telomeric region of the short arm of sex chromosomes.,We reliably annotated the TE fraction of the draft genome of spinach. FISH analysis indicates that Ogre/Tat lineage and the sex chromosome-specific satellites DNAs might participate in sex chromosome formation and evolution. Based on FISH signals of microsatellites, together with 45S rDNA, a fine karyotype of spinach was established. This study improves our knowledge of repetitive sequence organization in spinach genome and aids in accurate spinach karyotype construction.","18 January 2019","Repetitive sequence,Satellite DNA,Sex chromosome,Spinach,Transposable elements","dcl75@163.com,gaowujun@htu.cn","Chuan-Liang Deng or Wu-Jun Gao."

They are further divided into an enormous number of families which are, due to the high diversity of their nucleotide sequences, usually specific to a single or a group of closely related species. Previous attempts to group these families into broader categories reflecting their phylogenetic relationships were limited either to analyzing a narrow range of plant species or to analyzing a small numbers of elements. Furthermore, there is no reference database that allows for similarity based classification of LTR-retrotransposons.,We have assembled a database of retrotransposon encoded polyprotein domains sequences extracted from 5410 Ty1/copia elements and 8453 Ty3/gypsy elements sampled from 80 species representing major groups of green plants (Viridiplantae). Phylogenetic analysis of the three most conserved polyprotein domains (RT, RH and INT) led to dividing Ty1/copia and Ty3/gypsy retrotransposons into 16 and 14 lineages respectively. We also characterized various features of LTR-retrotransposon sequences including additional polyprotein domains, extra open reading frames and primer binding sites, and found that the occurrence and/or type of these features correlates with phylogenies inferred from the three protein domains.,We have established an improved classification system applicable to LTR-retrotransposons from a wide range of plant species. This system reflects phylogenetic relationships as well as distinct sequence and structural features of the elements. A comprehensive database of retrotransposon protein domains (REXdb) that reflects this classification provides a reference for efficient and unified annotation of LTR-retrotransposons in plant genomes.

The vast majority of HERV sequences descend from ancient retroviral families no longer capable of infection or genomic propagation. In fact, most are no longer represented by full-length proviruses but by solitary long terminal repeats (solo LTRs) that arose via non-allelic recombination events between the two LTRs of a proviral insertion. Because LTR-LTR recombination events may occur long after proviral insertion but are challenging to detect in resequencing data, we hypothesize that this mechanism is a source of genomic variation in the human population that remains vastly underestimated.,We developed a computational pipeline specifically designed to capture dimorphic proviral/solo HERV allelic variants from short-read genome sequencing data. When applied to 279 individuals sequenced as part of the Simons Genome Diversity Project, the pipeline retrieves most of the dimorphic loci previously reported for the HERV-K(HML2) subfamily as well as dozens of additional candidates, including members of the HERV-H and HERV-W families previously involved in human development and disease. We experimentally validate several of these newly discovered dimorphisms, including the first reported instance of an unfixed HERV-W provirus and an HERV-H locus driving a transcript (ESRG) implicated in the maintenance of embryonic stem cell pluripotency.,Our findings indicate that human proviral content exhibit more extensive interindividual variation than previously recognized, which has important bearings for deciphering the contribution of HERVs to human physiology and disease. Because LTR retroelements and LTR recombination are ubiquitous in eukaryotes, our computational pipeline should facilitate the mapping of this type of genomic variation for a wide range of organisms.","18 December 2018","Endogenous retrovirus,HERV-H,HERV-W,HERV-K,Transposable elements,Long terminal repeats,Provirus,Solo LTR","jainyt@genetics.utah.edu,cf458@cornell.edu","Jainy Thomas or Cédric Feschotte."

Several studies have drawn connections between altered retrotransposon expression and ALS. Certain features of the LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposon-encoded ORF1 protein (ORF1p) are analogous to those of neurodegeneration-associated RNA-binding proteins, including formation of cytoplasmic aggregates. In this study we explore these features and consider possible links between L1 expression and ALS.,We first considered factors that modulate aggregation and subcellular distribution of LINE-1 ORF1p, including nuclear localization. Changes to some ORF1p amino acid residues alter both retrotransposition efficiency and protein aggregation dynamics, and we found that one such polymorphism is present in endogenous L1s abundant in the human genome. We failed, however, to identify CRM1-mediated nuclear export signals in ORF1p nor strict involvement of cell cycle in endogenous ORF1p nuclear localization in human 2102Ep germline teratocarcinoma cells. Some proteins linked with ALS bind and colocalize with L1 ORF1p ribonucleoprotein particles in cytoplasmic RNA granules. Increased expression of several ALS-associated proteins, including TAR DNA Binding Protein (TDP-43), strongly limits cell culture retrotransposition, while some disease-related mutations modify these effects. Using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) of ALS tissues and reanalysis of publicly available RNA-Seq datasets, we asked if changes in expression of retrotransposons are associated with ALS. We found minimal altered expression in sporadic ALS tissues but confirmed a previous report of differential expression of many repeat subfamilies in C9orf72 gene-mutated ALS patients.,Here we extended understanding of the subcellular localization dynamics of the aggregation-prone LINE-1 ORF1p RNA-binding protein. However, we failed to find compelling evidence for misregulation of LINE-1 retrotransposons in sporadic ALS nor a clear effect of ALS-associated TDP-43 protein on L1 expression. In sum, our study reveals that the interplay of active retrotransposons and the molecular features of ALS are more complex than anticipated. Thus, the potential consequences of altered retrotransposon activity for ALS and other neurodegenerative disorders are worthy of continued investigation.","15 December 2018","","jgoodier@jhmi.edu","John L.

Based on the updated Repbase library, we re-annotated transposable elements (TEs) in four Caniformia genomes (giant panda, polar bear, domestic dog, and domestic ferret) and performed a systematic, genome-wide comparison focusing on the Carnivora-specific SINE family, Can-SINEs.,We found the majority of young recently integrated transposable elements are LINEs and SINEs in carnivore genomes. In particular, SINEC1_AMe, SINEC1B_AMe and SINEC_C1 are the top three most abundant Can-SINE subfamilies in the panda and polar bear genomes. Transposition in transposition analysis indicates that SINEC1_AMe and SINEC1B_AMe are the most active subfamilies in the panda and the polar bear genomes. SINEC2A1_CF and SINEC1A_CF subfamilies show a higher retrotransposition activity in the dog genome, and MVB2 subfamily is the most active Can-SINE in the ferret genome. As the giant panda is an endangered icon species, we then focused on the identification of panda specific Can-SINEs. With the panda-associated two-way genome alignments, we identified 250 putative panda-specific (PPS) elements (139 SINEC1_AMes and 111 SINEC1B_AMes) that inserted in the panda genome but were absent at the orthologous regions of the other three genomes. Further investigation of these PPS elements allowed us to identify a new Can-SINE subfamily, the SINEC1_AMe2, which was distinguishable from the current SINEC1_AMe consensus by four non-CpG sites. SINEC1_AMe2 has a high copy number (> 100,000) in the panda and polar bear genomes and the vast majority (> 96%) of the SINEC1_AMe2 elements have divergence rates less than 10% in both genomes.,Our results suggest that Can-SINEs show lineage-specific retransposition activity in the four genomes and have an important impact on the genomic landscape of different Caniformia lineages. Combining these observations with results from the COSEG, Network, and target site duplication analysis, we suggest that SINEC1_AMe2 is a young mobile element subfamily and currently active in both the panda and polar bear genomes.","10 November 2018","Caniformia species,Can-SINEs,Transposable element activity,Putative panda-specific elements","Xing@biology.rutgers.edu,ljtjf@126.com","Jinchuan Xing or Jing Li."

Here I present a detailed phylogeny of SVA_D elements in gorilla, chimpanzee and humans based on sorting of co-segregating substitutions. Complementary comparative genomics analysis revealed that the majority (1763 out of 1826–97%) of SVA_D elements in gorilla represent species-specific insertions – indicating very low activity of the subfamily before the gorilla/chimpanzee-human split. The origin of the human-specific subfamily SVA_F could be traced back to a source element in the hominine common ancestor. The major expanding lineage-specific subfamilies were found to differ between chimpanzee and humans. Precursors of the dominant chimpanzee SVA_D subfamily are present in humans; however, they did not expand to appreciable levels.,The analysis also uncovered that one of the chimpanzee-specific subfamilies was formed by splicing of the STK40 first exon to the SVA Alu-like region. Many of the 94 subfamily members contain additional 5′ transductions – among them exons of 8 different other genes.

Insertion sequence (IS) elements are the most common MGEs in bacterial genomes and play a crucial role in mediating large-scale variations in bacterial genomes. It is understood that IS elements and MGEs in general coexist in a dynamical equilibrium with their respective hosts. Current studies indicate that the spontaneous movement of IS elements does not follow a constant rate in different bacterial genomes. However, due to the paucity and sparsity of the data, these observations are yet to be conclusive. In this paper, we conducted a comparative analysis of the IS-mediated genome structural variations in ten mutation accumulation (MA) experiments across eight strains of five bacterial species containing IS elements, including four strains of the E. coli. We used GRASPER algorithm, a denovo structural variation (SV) identification algorithm designed to detect SVs involving repetitive sequences in the genome. We observed highly diverse rates of IS insertions and IS-mediated recombinations across different bacterial species as well as across different strains of the same bacterial species. We also observed different rates of the elements from the same IS family in different bacterial genomes, suggesting that the distinction in rates might not be due to the different composition of IS elements across bacterial genomes.","29 August 2018","Insertion sequence elements,Structural variations,Mutation accumulation,Bacterial genomes","enzabaru@indiana.edu","Etienne Nzabarushimana."

These analyses shortlisted a group of N-LTRr insertions that were found exclusively in Anatomically Modern Humans. These insertions are associated with an increase in the number of transcriptional/splicing variants of those genes they inserted in. The analysis of the functionality of genes containing human-specific N-LTRr insertions reflects changes that occurred during human evolution. In particular, the expression of genes containing the most recent N-LTRr insertions is enriched in the brain, especially in undifferentiated neurons, and these genes associate in networks related to neuron maturation and migration. Additionally, we identified candidate N-LTRr insertions that have likely produced new functional variants exclusive to modern humans, whose genomic loci show traces of positive selection.,Our results strongly suggest that N-LTRr impacted our differentiation as a species, most likely inducing an increase in neural complexity, and have been a constant source of genomic variability all throughout the evolution of the human lineage.","15 August 2018","Non-LTR retrotranspososons,Human evolution,Ancient genomes,Chimpanzees,Generation of variability,Functional analyses","etienne.guichard2@unibo.it,valentina.peona@ebc.uu.se,Alessio.boattini2@unibo.it","Etienne Guichard, Valentina Peona or Alessio Boattini."

Previously, we discovered a novel homing endonuclease F-CphI encoded by ORF177 of cyanophage S-PM2. F-CphI does not resemble any characterized homing endonucleases. Instead, the C-terminus of F-CphI aligns well with the N-terminal catalytic domain of a Holliday junction DNA resolvase, phage T4 endonuclease VII (Endo VII).,A PSI-BLAST search resulted in a total of 313 Endo VII motif–containing sequences in sequenced genomes. Multiple sequence alignment showed that the catalytically important residues of T4 Endo VII were all well conserved in these proteins. Our site-directed mutagenesis studies further confirmed that the catalytically important residues of T4 Endo VII were also essential for F-CphI activity, and thus F-CphI might use a similar protein fold as Endo VII for DNA cleavage. A phylogenetic tree of the Endo VII motif–containing sequences showed that putative resolvases grouped into one clade while putative homing endonucleases and restriction endonucleases grouped into another clade.,Based on the unique conserved residues, we proposed that F-CphI represents a new homing endonuclease family, which was named the DHHRN family. Our phylogenetic analysis could be used to predict the functions of many previously unknown proteins.","09 August 2018","Homing endonuclease,Group I intron,F-CphI,Endonuclease VII,Bacteriophage","zeng@ust.hk","Qinglu Zeng."
"185","Length variations within the Merle retrotransposon of canine PMEL: correlating genotype with phenotype","Sarah C. Murphy, Jacquelyn M. Evans, Kate L. Tsai and Leigh Anne Clark","The antisense insertion of a canine short interspersed element (SINEC_Cf) in the pigmentation gene PMEL (or SILV) causes a coat pattern phenotype in dogs termed merle. Merle is a semi-dominant trait characterized by patches of full pigmentation on a diluted background. The oligo(dT) tract of the Merle retrotransposon is long and uninterrupted and is prone to dramatic truncation. Phenotypically wild-type individuals carrying shorter oligo(dT) lengths of the Merle allele have been previously described and termed cryptic merles. Two additional coat patterns, dilute merle (uniform, steely-grey coat) and harlequin merle (white background with black patches), also appear in breeds segregating the Merle allele.,Sequencing of all PMEL exons in a dilute and a harlequin merle reveals that variation exists solely within the oligo(dT) tract of the SINEC_Cf insertion. In fragment analyses from 259 dogs heterozygous for Merle, we observed a spectrum of oligo(dT) lengths spanning 25 to 105 base pairs (bp), with ranges that correspond to the four varieties of the merle phenotype: cryptic (25–55 bp), dilute (66–74 bp), standard (78–86 bp), and harlequin (81–105 bp). Somatic contractions of the oligo(dT) were observed in 43% of standard and 51% of harlequin merle dogs. A small proportion (4.6%) of the study cohort inherited de novo contractions or expansions of the Merle allele that resulted in dilute or harlequin coat patterns, respectively.,The phenotypic consequence of the Merle SINE insertion directly depends upon oligo(dT) length. In transcription, we propose that the use of an alternative splice site increases with oligo(dT) length, resulting in insufficient PMEL and a pigment dilution spectrum, from dark grey to complete hypopigmentation. We further propose that during replication, contractions and expansions increase in frequency with oligo(dT) length, causing coat variegation (somatic events in melanocytes) and the spontaneous appearance of varieties of the merle phenotype (germline events).","03 August 2018","

Due to their ability to self-propagate within and between genomes, these elements can spread rapidly in populations.

C. neoformans has two mating types, MATa and MATα. In typical crosses between strains of the two mating types, only a small portion (< 7%) of diploid fusants inherited the HEGs from the MATα parent. However, disruption of the SXI1α gene resulted in the majority (> 95%) of the diploid fusants inheriting the HEG-containing introns from the MATα parent, a frequency significantly higher than those of intronless mitochondrial genes.,Our results suggest that SXI1α not only determines uniparental mitochondrial inheritance but also inhibits the spread of HEG-containing introns in the mitochondrial genome in C. neoformans.","17 July 2018","HEG,Intron,Mating type,mtDNA inheritance","jpxu@mcmaster.ca","Jianping Xu."

Such important component of many genomes are normally underscored in genomic analysis and detailed characterized mobilomes only exists for model species. In this study, we used a combination of de novo and homology approaches to characterize the Mobilome of two non-model parasitoid wasp species.,The different methodologies employed for TE characterization recovered TEs with different features as TE consensus number and size. Moreover, some TEs were detected only by one or few methodologies. RepeatExplorer and dnaPipeTE estimated a low TE content of 5.86 and 4.57% for Braconidae wasp and 5.22% and 7.42% for L. boulardi species, respectively. Both mobilomes are composed by a miscellaneous of ancient and recent elements. Braconidae wasps presented a large diversity of Maverick/Polintons Class II TEs while other TE superfamilies were more equally diverse in both species. Phylogenetic analysis of reconstructed elements showed that vertical transfer is the main mode of transmission.,Different methodologies should be used complementarity in order to achieve better mobilome characterization. Both wasps genomes have one of the lower mobilome estimates among all Hymenoptera genomes studied so far and presented a higher proportion of Class II than Class I TEs. The large majority of superfamilies analyzed phylogenetically showed that the elements are being inherited by vertical transfer. Overall, we achieved a deep characterization of the mobilome in two non-model parasitoid wasps improving our understanding of their evolution.","07 July 2018","Transposable elements,Repetitive elements,Evolution,Vertical transfer,Active mobilome","gabriel.wallau@cpqam.fiocruz.br","Gabriel Luz Wallau."

Faulkner and Victor Billon","Retrotransposons are transposable elements (TEs) capable of “jumping” in germ, embryonic and tumor cells and, as is now clearly established, in the neuronal lineage. Mosaic TE insertions form part of a broader landscape of somatic genome variation and hold significant potential to generate phenotypic diversity, in the brain and elsewhere. At present, the LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposon family appears to be the most active autonomous TE in most mammals, based on experimental data obtained from disease-causing L1 mutations, engineered L1 reporter systems tested in cultured cells and transgenic rodents, and single-cell genomic analyses. However, the biological consequences of almost all somatic L1 insertions identified thus far remain unknown. In this review, we briefly summarize the current state-of-the-art in the field, including estimates of L1 retrotransposition rate in neurons. We bring forward the hypothesis that an extensive subset of retrotransposition-competent L1s may be de-repressed and mobile in the soma but largely inactive in the germline. We discuss recent reports of non-canonical L1-associated sequence variants in the brain and propose that the elevated L1 DNA content reported in several neurological disorders may predominantly comprise accumulated, unintegrated L1 nucleic acids, rather than somatic L1 insertions. Finally, we consider the main objectives and obstacles going forward in elucidating the biological impact of somatic retrotransposition.","07 July 2018","LINE-1,L1,Genomics,Retrotransposon,Mosaicism,Neurobiology","faulknergj@gmail.com","Geoffrey J.

Within a genome, TE families may eventually become dormant due to host-silencing mechanisms, natural selection and the accumulation of inactive copies. The transmission of active copies from a TE families, both vertically and horizontally between species, can allow TEs to escape inactivation if it occurs often enough, as it may allow TEs to temporarily escape silencing in a new host. Thus, the contribution of horizontal exchange to TE persistence has been of increasing interest.,Here, we annotated TEs in five species with sequenced genomes from the D. pseudoobscura species group, and curated a set of TE families found in these species. We found that, compared to host genes, many TE families showed lower neutral divergence between species, consistent with recent transmission of TEs between species. Despite these transfers, there are differences in the TE content between species in the group.,The TE content is highly dynamic in the D. pseudoobscura species group, frequently transferring between species, keeping TEs active. This result highlights how frequently transposable elements are transmitted between sympatric species and, despite these transfers, how rapidly species TE content can diverge.","19 June 2018","Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINEs),Persimilis,Long Terminal Repeat (LTRs),Pipette DNA,Horizontal Transfer","tom.hill@ku.edu","Tom Hill."

Unlike in cellular organisms, TEs were previously thought to be either rare or absent in viruses. Almost all reported TEs display only one or two copies per viral genome. In addition, the discovery of pandoraviruses with genomes up to 2.5-Mb emphasizes the need for biologists to rethink the fundamental nature of the relationship between viruses and cellular life.,Herein, we performed the first comprehensive analysis of miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) in the 5170 viral genomes for which sequences are currently available. Four hundred and fifty one copies of ten miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) were found and each MITE had reached relatively large copy numbers (some up to 90) in viruses. Eight MITEs belonging to two DNA superfamilies (hobo/Activator/Tam3 and Chapaev–Mirage–CACTA) were for the first time identified in viruses, further expanding the organismal range of these two superfamilies. TEs may play important roles in shaping the evolution of pandoravirus genomes, which were here found to be very rich in MITEs. We also show that putative autonomous partners of seven MITEs are present in the genomes of viral hosts, suggesting that viruses may borrow the transpositional machinery of their cellular hosts’ autonomous elements to spread MITEs and colonize their own genomes. The presence of seven similar MITEs in viral hosts, suggesting horizontal transfers (HTs) as the major mechanism for MITEs propagation.,Our discovery highlights that TEs contribute to shape genome evolution of pandoraviruses.

Many cases of horizontal TE transfer (HTT) been reported in animals and plants, however surprisingly few examples of HTT have been reported in fungi.,Here I report evidence for a novel HTT event in fungi involving Tsu4 in Saccharomyces paradoxus based on (i) unexpectedly high similarity between Tsu4 elements in S. paradoxus and S. uvarum, (ii) a patchy distribution of Tsu4 in S. paradoxus and general absence from its sister species S. cerevisiae, and (iii) discordance between the phylogenetic history of Tsu4 sequences and species in the Saccharomyces sensu stricto group. Available data suggests the HTT event likely occurred somewhere in the Nearctic, Neotropic or Indo-Australian part of the S. paradoxus species range, and that a lineage related to S. uvarum or S. eubayanus was the likely donor species. The HTT event has led to massive proliferation of Tsu4 in the South American lineage of S. paradoxus, which exhibits partial reproductive isolation with other strains of this species because of multiple reciprocal translocations. Full-length Tsu4 elements are associated with both breakpoints of one of these reciprocal translocations.,This work shows that comprehensive analysis of TE sequences in essentially-complete genome assemblies derived from long-read sequencing provides new opportunities to detect HTT events in fungi and other organisms. This work also provides support for the hypothesis that HTT and subsequent TE proliferation can induce genome rearrangements that contribute to post-zygotic isolation in yeast.","12 June 2018","Transposable element,Horizontal transfer,Yeast,Genome rearrangement","cbergman@uga.edu","Casey M.

Adelson","Transposable elements (TEs) are primarily responsible for the DNA losses and gains in genome sequences that occur over time within and between species. TEs themselves evolve, with clade specific LTR/ERV, LINEs and SINEs responsible for the bulk of species-specific genomic features. Because TEs can contain regulatory motifs, they can be exapted as regulators of gene expression. While TE insertions can provide evolutionary novelty for the regulation of gene expression, their overall impact on the evolution of gene expression is unclear. Previous investigators have shown that tissue specific gene expression in amniotes is more similar across species than within species, supporting the existence of conserved developmental gene regulation. In order to understand how species-specific TE insertions might affect the evolution/conservation of gene expression, we have looked at the association of gene expression in six tissues with TE insertions in six representative amniote genomes.,A novel bootstrapping approach has been used to minimise the conflation of effects of repeat types on gene expression. We compared the expression of orthologs containing recent TE insertions to orthologs that contained older TE insertions, and the expression of non-orthologs containing recent TE insertions to non-orthologs with older TE insertions. Both orthologs and non-orthologs showed significant differences in gene expression associated with TE insertions. TEs were found associated with species-specific changes in gene expression, and the magnitude and direction of expression changes were noteworthy. Overall, orthologs containing species-specific TEs were associated with lower gene expression, while in non-orthologs, non-species specific TEs were associated with higher gene expression. Exceptions were SINE elements in human and chicken, which had an opposite association with gene expression compared to other species.,Our observed species-specific associations of TEs with gene expression support a role for TEs in speciation/response to selection by species. TEs do not exhibit consistent associations with gene expression and observed associations can vary depending on the age of TE insertions. Based on these observations, it would be prudent to refrain from extrapolating these and previously reported associations to distantly related species.","12 June 2018","Transposon,Gene expression,Amniotes,Evolution,Retrotransposon","david.adelson@adelaide.edu.au","David L.

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) Ty1–5 elements are long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons that are members of the Ty1-copia (Pseudoviridae) or Ty3-gypsy (Metaviridae) families. Four of the five S. cerevisiae Ty elements are inserted into the genome upstream of RNA Polymerase (Pol) III-transcribed genes such as transfer RNA (tRNA) genes. This particular genomic locus provides a safe environment for Ty element insertion without disruption of the host genome and is a targeting strategy used by retrotransposons that insert into compact genomes of hosts such as S. cerevisiae and the social amoeba Dictyostelium. The mechanism by which Ty1 targeting is achieved has been recently solved due to the discovery of an interaction between Ty1 Integrase (IN) and RNA Pol III subunits. We describe the methods used to identify the Ty1-IN interaction with Pol III and the Ty1 targeting consequences if the interaction is perturbed. The details of Ty1 targeting are just beginning to emerge and many unexplored areas remain including consideration of the 3-dimensional shape of genome. We present a variety of other retrotransposon families that insert adjacent to Pol III-transcribed genes and the mechanism by which the host machinery has been hijacked to accomplish this targeting strategy. Finally, we discuss why retrotransposons selected Pol III-transcribed genes as a target during evolution and how retrotransposons have shaped genome architecture.","23 April 2018","Retrotransposon,

It is unclear if patterns of evolution that are shared between those two groups apply to other mammalian orders. Here we performed a detailed study on the evolution of L1 in perissodactyls by making use of the complete genome of the domestic horse and of the white rhinoceros. This mammalian order offers an excellent model to study the extinction of L1 since the rhinoceros is one of the few mammalian species to have lost active L1.,We found that multiple L1 lineages, carrying different 5’UTRs, have been simultaneously active during the evolution of perissodactyls. We also found that L1 has continuously amplified and diversified in horse. In rhinoceros, L1 was very prolific early on. Two successful families were simultaneously active until ~20my ago but became extinct suddenly at exactly the same time.,The general pattern of L1 evolution in perissodactyls is very similar to what was previously described in mouse and human, suggesting some commonalities in the way mammalian genomes interact with L1.

Shepard, Baek Kim, Nerea Ferreirós and Thomas Gramberg","The restriction factor SAMHD1 regulates intracellular nucleotide level by degrading dNTPs and blocks the replication of retroviruses and DNA viruses in non-cycling cells, like macrophages or dendritic cells. In patients, inactivating mutations in samhd1 are associated with the autoimmune disease Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome (AGS). The accumulation of intracellular nucleic acids derived from endogenous retroelements thriving in the absence of SAMHD1 has been discussed as potential trigger of the autoimmune reaction. In vitro, SAMHD1 has been found to restrict endogenous retroelements, like LINE-1 elements (L1). The mechanism, however, by which SAMHD1 blocks endogenous retroelements, is still unclear.,Here, we show that SAMHD1 inhibits the replication of L1 and other endogenous retroelements in cycling cells. By applying GFP- and neomycin-based reporter assays we found that the anti-L1 activity of SAMHD1 is regulated by phosphorylation at threonine 592 (T592). Similar to the block of HIV, the cofactor binding site and the enzymatic active HD domain of SAMHD1 proofed to be essential for restriction of L1 elements. However, phosphorylation at T592 did not correlate with the dNTP hydrolase activity of SAMHD1 in cycling 293T cells suggesting an alternative mechanism of regulation. Interestingly, we found that SAMHD1 binds to ORF2 protein of L1 and that this interaction is regulated by T592 phosphorylation. Together with the finding that the block is also active in cycling cells, our results suggest that the SAMHD1-mediated inhibition of L1 is similar but not identical to HIV restriction.,Our findings show conclusively that SAMHD1 restricts the replication of endogenous retroelements in vitro. The results suggest that SAMHD1 is important for maintaining genome integrity and support the idea of an enhanced replication of endogenous retroelements in the absence of SAMHD1 in vivo, potentially triggering autoimmune diseases like AGS. Our analysis also contributes to the better understanding of the activities of SAMHD1 in antiviral defense and nucleotide metabolism. The finding that the phosphorylation of SAMHD1 at T592 regulates its activity against retroelements but not necessarily intracellular dNTP level suggests that the dNTP hydrolase activity might not be the only function of SAMHD1 important for its antiviral activity and for controlling autoimmunity.","28 March 2018","LINE-1,SAMHD1,Endogenous retroelements,Restriction factor,Aicardi-Goutières syndrome,Intrinsic immunity","thomas.gramberg@fau.de","Thomas Gramberg."

It is widely thought that SB exclusively integrates into TA dinucleotides. However, this strict TA-preference has not been rigorously tested in large numbers of insertion sites that now can be detected with next generation sequencing. Li et al. found 71 SB insertions in non-TA dinucleotides in 2013, suggesting that TA dinucleotides are not the only sites of SB integration, yet further studies on this topic have not been carried out.,In this study, we re-analyzed 600 million pairs of Illumina sequence reads from a high-throughput SB mutagenesis screen and identified 28 thousand SB insertions in non-TA sites. We recovered some of these non-TA sites using PCR and confirmed that at least a subset of the insertions at non-TA sites are real integrations. The consensus sequence of these non-TA sites shows an asymmetric pattern distinct from the symmetric pattern of the canonical TA sites. Perfect similarity between the downstream flanking sequence and SB transposon ends indicates there may be interaction between the transposon DNA binding domain of transposase and the target DNA.,The TA-preference of SB transposon is not as strict as what people had thought. And the SB integrations at non-TA sites might be guided by the interaction between the transposon DNA binding domain of SB transposase and the target DNA.","07 February 2018","Sleeping beauty,Transposon,Integration,Non-TA dinucleotide,Asymmetric,Non-palindromic","guoyb9@sysu.edu.cn","Yabin Guo."

Maternally deposited piRNAs suppress P-element transposition in the progeny, linking them to P-M phenotypes; however, the role of zygotic piRNAs derived from paternal P elements is poorly understood.,To elucidate the molecular basis of P-element suppression by zygotic factors, we investigated the genomic constitution and P-element piRNA production derived from fathers. As a result, we characterized males of naturally derived Q, M’ and P strains, which show different capacities for the P-element mobilizations introduced after hybridizations with M-strain females. The amounts of piRNAs produced in ovaries of F1 hybrids varied among the strains and were influenced by the characteristics of the piRNA clusters that harbored the P elements. Importantly, while both the Q- and M’-strain fathers restrict the P-element mobilization in ovaries of their daughters, the Q-strain fathers supported the production of the highest piRNA expression in the ovaries of their daughters, and the M’ strain carries KP elements in transcriptionally active regions directing the highest expression of KP elements in their daughters. Interestingly, the zygotic P-element piRNAs, but not the KP element mRNA, contributed to the variations in P transposition immunity in the granddaughters.,The piRNA-cluster-embedded P elements and the transcriptionally active KP elements from the paternal genome are both important suppressors of P element activities that are co-inherited by the progeny. Expression levels of the P-element piRNA and KP-element mRNA vary among F1 progeny due to the constitution of the paternal genome, and are involved in phenotypic variation in the subsequent generation.","06 February 2018","Zygotic piRNAs,Paternal P elements,piRNA cluster,Hybrid dysgenesis,Natural strains","d2811509@edu.kit.ac.jp,mitoh@kit.ac.jp","Keiko Tsuji Wakisaka or Masanobu Itoh."

DNA is being inherited through generations by vertical transmission (VT) from parents to offspring and from ancestor to descendant species. This process was considered the sole pathway by which biological entities exchange inheritable information. However, Horizontal Transfer (HT), the exchange of genetic information by other means than parents to offspring, was discovered in prokaryotes along with strong evidence showing that it is a very important process by which prokaryotes acquire new genes.,For some time now, it has been a scientific consensus that HT events were rare and non-relevant for evolution of eukaryotic species, but there is growing evidence supporting that HT is an important and frequent phenomenon in eukaryotes as well.,Here, we will discuss the latest findings regarding HT among eukaryotes, mainly HT of transposons (HTT), establishing HTT once and for all as an important phenomenon that should be taken into consideration to fully understand eukaryotes genome evolution. In addition, we will discuss the latest development methods to detect such events in a broader scale and highlight the new approaches which should be pursued by researchers to fill the knowledge gaps regarding HTT among eukaryotes.","31 January 2018","Horizontal transfer,Horizontal transmission,Detection methods,Impact on host genomes,Transposable elements","gabriel.wallau@cpqam.fiocruz.br","Gabriel Luz Wallau."

All three islands are implicated as virulence factors, although whereas the cagPAI is well characterised, understanding of how the tfs elements influence H. pylori interactions with different human hosts is significantly confounded by limited definition of their distribution, diversity and structural representation in the global H. pylori population.,To gain a global perspective of tfs ICE population dynamics we established a bioinformatics workflow to extract and precisely define the full tfs pan-gene content contained within a global collection of 221 draft and complete H. pylori genome sequences. Complete (ca. 35-55kbp) and remnant tfs ICE clusters were reconstructed from a dataset comprising > 12,000 genes, from which orthologous gene complements and distinct alleles descriptive of different tfs ICE types were defined and classified in comparative analyses. The genetic variation within defined ICE modular segments was subsequently used to provide a complete description of tfs ICE diversity and a comprehensive assessment of their phylogeographic context. Our further examination of the apparent ICE modular types identified an ancient and complex history of ICE residence, mobility and interaction within particular H. pylori phylogeographic lineages and further, provided evidence of both contemporary inter-lineage and inter-species ICE transfer and displacement.,Our collective results establish a clear view of tfs ICE diversity and phylogeographic representation in the global H. pylori population, and provide a robust contextual framework for elucidating the functional role of the tfs ICEs particularly as it relates to the risk of gastric disease associated with different tfs ICE genotypes.","26 January 2018","Integrative and conjugative element (ICE),

Green, Olga Novikova and Marlene Belfort","Inteins are mobile, self-splicing sequences that interrupt proteins and occur across all three domains of life. Scrutiny of the intein landscape in prokaryotes led to the hypothesis that some inteins are functionally important. Our focus shifts to eukaryotic inteins to assess their diversity, distribution, and dissemination, with the aim to comprehensively evaluate the eukaryotic intein landscape, understand intein maintenance, and dissect evolutionary relationships.,This bioinformatics study reveals that eukaryotic inteins are scarce, but present in nuclear genomes of fungi, chloroplast genomes of algae, and within some eukaryotic viruses. There is a preponderance of inteins in several fungal pathogens of humans and plants. Inteins are pervasive in certain proteins, including the nuclear RNA splicing factor, Prp8, and the chloroplast DNA helicase, DnaB. We find that eukaryotic inteins frequently localize to unstructured loops of the host protein, often at highly conserved sites. More broadly, a sequence similarity network analysis of all eukaryotic inteins uncovered several routes of intein mobility. Some eukaryotic inteins appear to have been acquired through horizontal transfer with dsDNA viruses, yet other inteins are spread through intragenomic transfer. Remarkably, endosymbiosis can explain patterns of DnaB intein inheritance across several algal phyla, a novel mechanism for intein acquisition and distribution.,Overall, an intriguing picture emerges for how the eukaryotic intein landscape arose, with many evolutionary forces having contributed to its current state. Our collective results provide a framework for exploring inteins as novel regulatory elements and innovative drug targets.","24 January 2018","Intein,Mobile elements,Horizontal transfer,Endosymbiosis,Sequence similarity network","mbelfort@albany.edu","Marlene Belfort."

It encodes a fusion transposase OrfAB produced by programmed − 1 translational frameshifting with two overlapping reading frames orfA and orfB. To better characterize ISSau2, the binding and cleaving activities of the ISSau2 transposase and its transposition frequency were studied.,The purified ISSau2 transposase OrfAB was a functional protein in vitro since it bound specifically to ISSau2 terminal inverted repeat sequences (IRs) and cleaved the transposon ends at the artificial mini-transposon pUC19-IRL-gfp-IRR. In addition, the transposition frequency of ISSau2 in vivo was approximately 1.76 ± 0.13 × 10− 3, based on a GFP hop-on assay. Furthermore, OrfB cleaved IRs with the similar catalytic activity of OrfAB, while OrfA had no catalytic activity. Finally, either OrfA or OrfB significantly reduced the transposition of ISSau2 induced by OrfAB.,We have confirmed that ISSau2 is a member of IS150/IS3 family. The ISSau2 transposase OrfAB could bind to and cleave the specific fragments containing the terminal inverted repeat sequences and induce the transposition, suggesting that ISSau2 is at least partially functional. Meanwhile, both OrfA and OrfB inhibited the transposition by ISSau2. Our results will help understand biological roles of ISSau2 in its host S. aureus.","16 January 2018","ISSau2,Functional insertion sequence,IS150,Transposition frequency","xin.zhao@mcgill.ca","Xin Zhao."

Kojima","Repbase is a comprehensive database of eukaryotic transposable elements (TEs) and repeat sequences, containing over 1300 human repeat sequences. Recent analyses of these repeat sequences have accumulated evidences for their contribution to human evolution through becoming functional elements, such as protein-coding regions or binding sites of transcriptional regulators. However, resolving the origins of repeat sequences is a challenge, due to their age, divergence, and degradation. Ancient repeats have been continuously classified as TEs by finding similar TEs from other organisms. Here, the most comprehensive picture of human repeat sequences is presented. The human genome contains traces of 10 clades (L1, CR1, L2, Crack, RTE, RTEX, R4, Vingi, Tx1 and Penelope) of non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons (long interspersed elements, LINEs), 3 types (SINE1/7SL, SINE2/tRNA, and SINE3/5S) of short interspersed elements (SINEs), 1 composite retrotransposon (SVA) family, 5 classes (ERV1, ERV2, ERV3, Gypsy and DIRS) of LTR retrotransposons, and 12 superfamilies (Crypton, Ginger1, Harbinger, hAT, Helitron, Kolobok, Mariner, Merlin, MuDR, P, piggyBac and Transib) of DNA transposons.

Expression of LINE-1 is tightly repressed in most somatic tissues to prevent DNA damage and ensure genomic integrity. However, the reactivation of LINE-1 has been documented in cancer and the role of LINE-1 protein expression and retrotransposition has become of interest in the development, progression, and adaptation of many epithelial neoplasms, including prostate cancer.,Here, we examined endogenous LINE-1 protein expression and localization in a panel of prostate cancer cells and observed a diverse range of LINE-1 expression patterns between cell lines. Subcellular localization of LINE-1 proteins, ORF1p and ORF2p, revealed distinct expression patterns. ORF1p, a nucleic acid chaperone that binds LINE-1 mRNA, was predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm, with minor localization in the nucleus. ORF2p, containing endonuclease and reverse transcriptase domains, exhibited punctate foci in the nucleus and also displayed co-localization with PCNA and γH2AX. Using a retrotransposition reporter assay, we found variations in LINE-1 retrotransposition between cell lines.,Overall, our findings reveal new insight into the expression and retrotransposition of LINE-1 in prostate cancer. The prostate cancer cells we investigated provide a unique model for investigating endogenous LINE-1 activity and provide a functional model for studying LINE-1 mechanisms in prostate cancer.","03 January 2018","Transposable element,Prostate cancer,Tumor cell biology,Protein expression,Fluorescence,LINE-1,Retrotransposition","Susan.Logan@nyumc.org","Susan K.

Especially in large genomes where TEs make the majority of genomic DNA, it is still unclear whether TEs target specific chromosomal regions or whether they simply accumulate where they are best tolerated.,Here, we present an analysis of the repetitive fraction of the 5100 Mb barley genome, the largest angiosperm genome to have a near-complete sequence assembly. Genes make only about 2% of the genome, while over 80% is derived from TEs. The TE fraction is composed of at least 350 different families. However, 50% of the genome is comprised of only 15 high-copy TE families, while all other TE families are present in moderate or low copy numbers. We found that the barley genome is highly compartmentalized with different types of TEs occupying different chromosomal “niches”, such as distal, interstitial, or proximal regions of chromosome arms. Furthermore, gene space represents its own distinct genomic compartment that is enriched in small non-autonomous DNA transposons, suggesting that these TEs specifically target promoters and downstream regions. Furthermore, their presence in gene promoters is associated with decreased methylation levels.,Our data show that TEs are major determinants of overall chromosome structure. We hypothesize that many of the the various chromosomal distribution patterns are the result of TE families targeting specific niches, rather than them accumulating where they have the least deleterious effects.","20 December 2017","Barley Genome,Repetitive Landscape,Methylation Levels,Transposable Elements,Helitrons","wicker@botinst.uzh.ch","Thomas Wicker."

The genome of the zebra finch, a passerine model organism for vocal learning, was noted previously to contain thousands of short interspersed elements (SINEs), a group of retroposons that is abundant in mammalian genomes but considered largely inactive in avian genomes.,Here we resolve the deep phylogenetic relationships of passerines using presence/absence patterns of SINEs. The resultant retroposon-based phylogeny provides a powerful and independent corroboration of previous sequence-based analyses. Notably, SINE activity began in the common ancestor of Eupasseres (passerines excluding the New Zealand wrens Acanthisittidae) and ceased before the rapid diversification of oscine passerines (suborder Passeri – songbirds). Furthermore, we find evidence for very recent SINE activity within suboscine passerines (suborder Tyranni), following the emergence of a SINE via acquisition of a different tRNA head as we suggest through template switching.,We propose that the early evolution of passerines was unusual among birds in that it was accompanied by de-novo emergence and activity of SINEs. Their genomic and transcriptomic impact warrants further study in the light of the massive diversification of passerines.","14 December 2017","Transposon,Retroposon,SINE,Birds,Passeriformes,Phylogenomics","alexander.suh@ebc.uu.se","Alexander Suh."

This variation is believed to arise from differences in the epigenetic state (e.g., DNA methylation) of the 5′ long terminal repeat (LTR), where transcription starts. However, owing to the high copy number and high sequence similarity between copies, it is difficult to analyze the epigenetic states of individual IAP LTRs in a comprehensive manner.,We have developed a method called Target Enrichment after Post-Bisulfite Adaptor Tagging (TEPBAT) to analyze the DNA methylation states of a large number of individual retrotransposon copies at once. Using this method, we determined the DNA methylation levels of >8500 copies of genomic IAP LTRs (almost all copies that we aimed to target by the PCR primers) in the sperm and tail. This revealed that the vast majority of the LTRs were heavily methylated in both sperm and tail; however, hypomethylated copies were more frequently found in the sperm than in the tail. Interestingly, most of these hypomethylated LTRs were solo-type, belonged to specific IAP subfamilies, and carried binding sites for transcription factors (TFs) that are active in male germ cells.,The current study revealed subfamily- and locus-specific hypomethylation of IAP LTRs, and suggests that binding of TFs is involved in the protection from DNA methylation, whereas the IAP internal sequence enhances methylation. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that TEPBAT offers a cost-effective method for a variety of DNA methylome studies that focus on retrotransposon sequences.","13 December 2017","DNA methylome,Intracisternal A particle,Endogenouse retrovirus,Transcription factor,Spermatogenesis,Mouse","ichiyana@agr.nagoya-u.ac.jp","Kenji Ichiyanagi."

One suggested explanation for this observation was the possibility that L1 inserted randomly, but that there was negative selection against sense-oriented insertions. However, multiple studies have now found that de novo and polymorphic L1 insertions, which have little opportunity for selection to act, also show the same bias.,Here we show that the transcription-coupled sub-pathway of nucleotide excision repair does not affect the overall rate of insertion of L1 elements, which is in contrast with the regulation by the global sub-pathway of nucleotide excision repair. The transcription-coupled subpathway does cause a strong bias against insertion in the sense orientation relative to genes.,This suggests that a major portion of the L1 orientation bias might be generated during the process of insertion through the action of transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair.","06 December 2017","L1 retrotransposon,Transcription-coupled repair,Target-primed reverse transcription,DNA repair,Mutagenesis","pdeinin@tulane.edu","Prescott L.

Retrotransposons are genetic elements that mobilize via an RNA intermediate by a “copy-and-paste” mechanism termed retrotransposition. Long Interspersed Element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) is the only active autonomous retrotransposon in humans and its activity is responsible for ~ 30% of genomic mass. Historically, L1 retrotransposition was thought to be restricted to the germline; however, new data indicate L1 s are active in somatic tissue with certain regions of the brain being highly permissive. The functional implications of L1 insertional activity in the brain and how host cells regulate it are incomplete. While deep sequencing and qPCR analysis have shown that L1 copy number is much higher in certain parts of the human brain, direct in vivo studies regarding detection of L1-encoded proteins is lacking due to ineffective reagents.,Using a polyclonal antibody we generated against the RNA-binding (RRM) domain of L1 ORF1p, we observe widespread ORF1p expression in post-mortem human brain samples including the hippocampus which has known elevated rates of retrotransposition. In addition, we find that two brains from different individuals of different ages display very different expression of ORF1p, especially in the frontal cortex.,We hypothesize that discordance of ORF1p expression in parts of the brain reported to display elevated levels of retrotransposition may suggest the existence of factors mediating post-translational regulation of L1 activity in the human brain. Furthermore, this antibody reagent will be useful as a complementary means to confirm findings related to retrotransposon biology and activity in the brain and other tissues in vivo.","22 November 2017","Retrotransposon,LINE-1,ORF1p antibody,Active retrotransposition in human brain,Somatic mosaicism","mandal.prabhat@gmail.com","Prabhat K.

Christensen","R2 elements are a clade of early branching Long Interspersed Elements (LINEs). LINEs are retrotransposable elements whose replication can have profound effects on the genomes in which they reside. No crystal or EM structures exist for the reverse transcriptase (RT) and linker regions of LINEs.,Using limited proteolysis as a probe for globular domain structure, we show that the protein encoded by the Bombyx mori R2 element has two major globular domains: (1) a small globular domain consisting of the N-terminal zinc finger and Myb motifs, and (2) a large globular domain consisting of the RT, linker, and type II restriction-like endonuclease (RLE). Further digestion of the large globular domain occurred within the RT. Mapping these RT cleavages onto an updated model of the R2Bm RT indicated that the thumb of the RT was largely protected from proteolytic cleavage. The crystal structure of the large globular domain of Prp8, a eukaryotic splicing factor, was a major template used in building the R2Bm RT model, particularly the thumb region. The large fragment of Prp8 consists not only of a RT similar to R2Bm, but also an RLE and a linker connecting the two regions. The linker sequences adjacent to the RLE in LINEs and Prp8 share a set of two important α-helices and a (presumptive) knuckle/ββα structural motif that are closely associated with the thumb. The RLEs of LINEs and Prp8 share a unique catalytic core residue spacing as well as other key residues.,The protein encoded by RLE LINEs consists of two major globular domains. The larger of the two globular domain contains the RT, linker, and RLE and is similar to the large fragment of the spliceosomal protein Prp8.

In total, 91 intact LTR-RTs were identified and classified into four TGTT and four AACA families. A structural annotation analysis showed that the four TGTT families, together with AACA1 and AACA2, belong to the Copia-like superfamily, whereas AACA3 and AACA4 appeared to be TRIM elements. The average amplification time frames for the eight families ranged from 0.05 to 2.32 million years. Phylogenetics coupled with sequence analyses revealed that the TGTT1 elements of peach were horizontally transferred from apple. In addition, 32 elements from two TGTT and three AACA families had detectable transcriptional activation, and a qRT-PCR analysis indicated that their expression levels varied dramatically in different species, organs and stress treatments.,Two novel LTR-RT subfamilies that terminated with non-palindromic dinucleotides at the ends of their LTRs were identified in four Rosaceae species, and a deep analysis showed their recent activity, horizontal transfer and varied transcriptional levels in different species, organs and stress treatments.

For the P strain, the P–M phenotypes are associated with the ability to express a class of small RNAs, called piwi-interacting small RNAs (piRNAs), that suppress the P elements in female gonads. However, little is known about the extent to which piRNAs are involved in the P–M hybrid dysgenesis in M′ and Q strains, which show different abilities to regulate the P elements from P strains.,To elucidate the molecular basis of the suppression of paternally inherited P elements, we analyzed the mRNA and piRNA levels of P elements in the F1 progeny between males of a P strain and nine-line females of M′ or Q strains (M′ or Q progenies). M′ progenies showed the hybrid dysgenesis phenotype, while Q progenies did not. Consistently, the levels of P-element mRNA in both the ovaries and F1 embryos were higher in M′ progenies than in Q progenies, indicating that the M′ progenies have a weaker ability to suppress P-element expression. The level of P-element mRNA was inversely correlated to the level of piRNAs in F1 embryos. Importantly, the M′ progenies were characterized by a lower abundance of P-element piRNAs in both young ovaries and F1 embryonic bodies. The Q progenies showed various levels of piRNAs in both young ovaries and F1 embryonic bodies despite all of the Q progenies suppressing P-element transposition in their gonad.,Our results are consistent with an idea that the level of P-element piRNAs is a determinant for dividing strain types between M′ and Q and that the suppression mechanisms of transposable elements, including piRNAs, are varied between natural populations.","23 October 2017","Ping-pong-paired piRNA,Natural populations,Hybrid sterility,Gonadal dysgenesis,

Vast populations prey on the cellular microbiota in all habitats, including the human gut.,Here we review approaches for studying the human virome, and some recent results on movement of viral sequences between bacterial cells and eukaryotic hosts. We first overview biochemical and bioinformatic methods, emphasizing that specific choices in the methods used can have strong effects on the results obtained. We then review studies characterizing the virome of the healthy human gut, which reveal that most of the viruses detected are typically uncharacterized phage - the viral dark matter - and that viruses that infect human cells are encountered only rarely. We then review movement of phage between bacterial cells during antibiotic treatment. Here a radical proposal for extensive movement of antibiotic genes on phage has been challenged by a careful reanalysis of the metagenomic annotation methods used. We then review two recent studies of movement of whole phage communities between human individuals during fecal microbial transplantation, which emphasize the possible role of lysogeny in dispersal.,Methods for studying the human gut virome are improving, yielding interesting data on movement of phage genes between cells and mammalian host organisms. However, viral populations are vast, and studies of their composition and function are just beginning.","03 October 2017","Virus,Bacteriophage,Virome,Microbiome,Metagenomics,DNA,Transduction","bushman@mail.med.upenn.edu","Frederic D.

Although several genomes have been screened for TEs, so far very limited information is available regarding avian TEs and their evolutionary histories. Taking advantage of the rich genomic data available for birds, we characterized the evolutionary history of the galluhop element, originally described in Gallus gallus, through the use of several bioinformatic analyses.,
                           galluhop homologous sequences were found in 6 of 72 genomes analyzed: 5 species of Galliformes (Gallus gallus, Meleagris gallopavo, Coturnix japonica, Colinus virginianus, Lyrurus tetrix) and one Buceritiformes (Buceros rhinoceros). The copy number ranged from 5 to 10,158, in the genomes of C. japonica and G. gallus respectively. All 6 species possessed short elements, suggesting the presence of Miniature Inverted repeats Transposable Elements (MITEs), which underwent an ancient massive amplification in the G. gallus and M. gallopavo genomes. Only 4 species showed potential MITE full-length partners, although no potential coding copies were detected. Phylogenetic analysis of reconstructed coding sequences showed that galluhop homolog sequences form a new mariner subfamily, which we termed Gallus. Inter-species and intragenomic galluhop distance analyses indicated a high identity between the consensus of B. rhinoceros and the other 5 related species, and different emergence ages of the element between the Galliformes species and B. rhinocerus, suggesting that horizontal transfer took place from Galliformes to a Buceritiformes ancestor, probably through an intermediate species.,Overall, our results showed that mariner elements have amplified to high copy numbers in some avian species, and that this transposition burst probably occurred in the common ancestor of G. gallus and M. gallopavo. In addition, although no coding sequences could be found currently, they probably existed, allowing an ancient massive MITE amplification in these 2 species. The other 4 species also have MITEs, suggesting that this new mariner family is prone to give rise to such non-autonomous derivatives. Last, our results suggest that a horizontal transfer event of a galluhop element occurred between Galliformes and Buceritiformes.","14 August 2017","

Kelleher","Transposable elements (TEs) are major components of eukaryotic genomes and drivers of genome evolution, producing intraspecific polymorphism and interspecific differences through mobilization and non-homologous recombination. TE insertion sites are often highly variable within species, creating a need for targeted genome re-sequencing (TGS) methods to identify TE insertion sites.,We present a hemi-specific PCR approach for TGS of P-elements in Drosophila genomes on the Illumina platform. We also present a computational framework for identifying new insertions from TGS reads. Finally, we describe a new method for estimating the frequency of TE insertions from WGS data, which is based precise insertion sites provided by TGS annotations.,By comparing our results to TE annotations based on whole genome re-sequencing (WGS) data for the same Drosophila 
                           melanogaster strain, we demonstrate that TGS is powerful for identifying true insertions, even in repeat-rich heterochromatic regions. We also demonstrate that TGS offers enhanced annotation of precise insertion sites, which facilitates estimation of TE insertion frequency.,TGS by hemi-specific PCR is a powerful approach for identifying TE insertions of particular TE families in species with a high-quality reference genome, at greatly reduced cost as compared to WGS. It may therefore be ideal for population genomic studies of particular TE families. Additionally, TGS and WGS can be used as complementary approaches, with TGS annotations identifying more annotated insertions with greater precision for a target TE family, and WGS data allowing for estimates of TE insertion frequencies, and a broader picture of the location of non-target TEs across the genome.","28 July 2017","Transposable Elements,Precise Insertion Site,Insertion Accuracy,Population Genomic Studies,Adjacent Genomic Sequences","eskelleher@uh.edu","Erin S.

Jorde","Polymorphic human Alu elements are excellent tools for assessing population structure, and new retrotransposition events can contribute to disease. Next-generation sequencing has greatly increased the potential to discover Alu elements in human populations, and various sequencing and bioinformatics methods have been designed to tackle the problem of detecting these highly repetitive elements. However, current techniques for Alu discovery may miss rare, polymorphic Alu elements. Combining multiple discovery approaches may provide a better profile of the polymorphic Alu mobilome. AluYb8/9 elements have been a focus of our recent studies as they are young subfamilies (~2.3 million years old) that contribute ~30% of recent polymorphic Alu retrotransposition events. Here, we update our ME-Scan methods for detecting Alu elements and apply these methods to discover new insertions in a large set of individuals with diverse ancestral backgrounds.,We identified 5,288 putative Alu insertion events, including several hundred novel AluYb8/9 elements from 213 individuals from 18 diverse human populations. Hundreds of these loci were specific to continental populations, and 23 non-reference population-specific loci were validated by PCR. We provide high-quality sequence information for 68 rare AluYb8/9 elements, of which 11 have hallmarks of an active source element. Our subfamily distribution of rare AluYb8/9 elements is consistent with previous datasets, and may be representative of rare loci. We also find that while ME-Scan and low-coverage, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) detect different Alu elements in 41 1000 Genomes individuals, the two methods yield similar population structure results.,Current in-silico methods for Alu discovery may miss rare, polymorphic Alu elements. Therefore, using multiple techniques can provide a more accurate profile of Alu elements in individuals and populations. We improved our false-negative rate as an indicator of sample quality for future ME-Scan experiments. In conclusion, we demonstrate that ME-Scan is a good supplement for next-generation sequencing methods and is well-suited for population-level analyses.","27 July 2017","Retrotransposon,Mobilome,Polymorphism,Population genetics,Human ancestry,Ancestry informative markers","jfeusier@genetics.utah.edu","Julie Feusier."

Husarek, Jonathan C. Sanford, Teresa L. Sullivan, Pawan Kumar Tiwary, Wenfeng An, Jef D. Boeke and David E. Symer","The ongoing mobilization of mammalian transposable elements (TEs) contributes to natural genetic variation. To survey the epigenetic control and expression of reporter genes inserted by L1 retrotransposition in diverse cellular and genomic contexts, we engineered highly sensitive, real-time L1 retrotransposon reporter constructs.,Here we describe different patterns of expression and epigenetic controls of newly inserted sequences retrotransposed by L1 in various somatic cells and tissues including cultured human cancer cells, mouse embryonic stem cells, and tissues of pseudofounder transgenic mice and their progeny. In cancer cell lines, the newly inserted sequences typically underwent rapid transcriptional gene silencing, but they lacked cytosine methylation even after many cell divisions. L1 reporter expression was reversible and oscillated frequently. Silenced or variegated reporter expression was strongly and uniformly reactivated by treatment with inhibitors of histone deacetylation, revealing the mechanism for their silencing. By contrast, de novo integrants retrotransposed by L1 in pluripotent mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells underwent rapid silencing by dense cytosine methylation. Similarly, de novo cytosine methylation also was identified at new integrants when studied in several distinct somatic tissues of adult founder mice. Pre-existing L1 elements in cultured human cancer cells were stably silenced by dense cytosine methylation, whereas their transcription modestly increased when cytosine methylation was experimentally reduced in cells lacking DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3b. As a control, reporter genes mobilized by piggyBac (PB), a DNA transposon, revealed relatively stable and robust expression without apparent silencing in both cultured cancer cells and ES cells.,We hypothesize that the de novo methylation marks at newly inserted sequences retrotransposed by L1 in early pre-implantation development are maintained or re-established in adult somatic tissues. By contrast, histone deacetylation reversibly silences L1 reporter insertions that had mobilized at later timepoints in somatic development and differentiation, e.g., in cancer cell lines. We conclude that the cellular contexts of L1 retrotransposition can determine expression or silencing of newly integrated sequences. We propose a model whereby reporter expression from somatic TE insertions reflects the timing, molecular mechanism, epigenetic controls and the genomic, cellular and developmental contexts of their integration.","10 May 2017","Cytosine Methylation,Reporter Expression,Culture Cancer Cell,Embryonic Stem Cell Clone,Artificial Intron","david.symer@osumc.edu","David E.

Even among closely related species, the variation of TE amount may be striking, as for example between the two sibling species, Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans. However, not much is known concerning the TE content and dynamics among other Drosophila species. The sequencing of several Drosophila genomes, covering the two subgenus Sophophora and Drosophila, revealed a large variation of the repeat content among these species but no much information is known concerning their precise TE content. The identification of some consensus sequences of TEs from the various sequenced Drosophila species allowed to get an idea concerning their variety in term of diversity of superfamilies but the used classification remains very elusive and ambiguous.,We choose to focus on LTR-retrotransposons because they represent the most widely represented class of TEs in the Drosophila genomes. In this work, we describe for the first time the phylogenetic relationship of each LTR-retrotransposon family described in 20 Drosophila species, compute their proportion in their respective genomes and identify several new cases of horizontal transfers.,All these results allow us to have a clearer view on the evolutionary history of LTR retrotransposons among Drosophila that seems to be mainly driven by vertical transmissions although the implications of horizontal transfers, losses and intra-specific diversification are clearly also at play.","27 April 2017","LTR-retrotransposons,Drosophila,Horizontal transfer,Transposable element dynamics","emmanuelle.lerat@univ-lyon1.fr","Emmanuelle Lerat."

Payer","Polymorphic Alu elements account for 17% of structural variants in the human genome. The majority of these belong to the youngest AluY subfamilies, and most structural variant discovery efforts have focused on identifying Alu polymorphisms from these currently retrotranspositionally active subfamilies. In this report we analyze polymorphisms from the evolutionarily older AluS subfamily, whose peak activity was tens of millions of years ago. We annotate the AluS polymorphisms, assess their likely mechanism of origin, and evaluate their contribution to structural variation in the human genome.,Of 52 previously reported polymorphic AluS elements ascertained for this study, 48 were confirmed to belong to the AluS subfamily using high stringency subfamily classification criteria. Of these, the majority (77%, 37/48) appear to be deletion polymorphisms. Two polymorphic AluS elements (4%) have features of non-classical Alu insertions and one polymorphic AluS element (2%) likely inserted by a mechanism involving internal priming. Seven AluS polymorphisms (15%) appear to have arisen by the classical target-primed reverse transcription (TPRT) retrotransposition mechanism. These seven TPRT products are 3′ intact with 3′ poly-A tails, and are flanked by target site duplications; L1 ORF2p endonuclease cleavage sites were also observed, providing additional evidence that these are L1 ORF2p endonuclease-mediated TPRT insertions. Further sequence analysis showed strong conservation of both the RNA polymerase III promoter and SRP9/14 binding sites, important for mediating transcription and interaction with retrotransposition machinery, respectively. This conservation of functional features implies that some of these are fairly recent insertions since they have not diverged significantly from their respective retrotranspositionally competent source elements.,Of the polymorphic AluS elements evaluated in this report, 15% (7/48) have features consistent with TPRT-mediated insertion, thus suggesting that some AluS elements have been more active recently than previously thought, or that fixation of AluS insertion alleles remains incomplete. These data expand the potential significance of polymorphic AluS elements in contributing to structural variation in the human genome. Future discovery efforts focusing on polymorphic AluS elements are likely to identify more such polymorphisms, and approaches tailored to identify deletion alleles may be warranted.","24 April 2017","Retrotransposon,Mobile element,SINE,

All members of this class rely on reverse transcriptase activity to produce a DNA copy of the element from the RNA template. However, other activities of the retrotransposon-encoded polyprotein may differ between diverse retrotransposons. The polyprotein domains corresponding to each of these activities may have their own evolutionary history independent from that of the reverse transcriptase, thus underlying the modular view on the evolution of retrotransposons. Furthermore, some transposable elements can independently evolve similar domain architectures by acquiring functionally similar but phylogenetically distinct modules. This convergent evolution of retrotransposons may ultimately suggest similar regulatory pathways underlying the lifecycle of the elements.,Here, we provide new examples of the convergent evolution of retrotransposons of species from two unrelated taxa: green plants and parasitic protozoan oomycetes. In the present study we first analyzed the available genomic sequences of oomycete species and characterized two groups of Ty3/Gypsy long terminal repeat retrotransposons, namely Chronos and Archon, and a subgroup of L1 non-long terminal repeat retrotransposons. The results demonstrated that the retroelements from these three groups each have independently acquired plant-related ribonuclease H domains. This process closely resembles the evolution of retrotransposons in the genomes of green plants. In addition, we showed that Chronos elements captured a chromodomain, mimicking the process of chromodomain acquisition by Chromoviruses, another group of Ty3/Gypsy retrotransposons of plants, fungi, and vertebrates.,Repeated and strikingly similar acquisitions of ribonuclease H domains and chromodomains by different retrotransposon groups from unrelated taxa indicate similar selection pressure acting on these elements. Thus, there are some major trends in the evolution of the structural composition of retrotransposons, and characterizing these trends may enhance the current understanding of the retrotransposon life cycle.","14 March 2017","Convergent evolution,Retrotransposons,Plants,Oomycetes,Ribonuclease H,Chromodomain","ustyantsev@bionet.nsc.ru","Kirill Ustyantsev."

These include choices for the reference dataset, the normalization of multiply mapping sRNAs, and the selection among sRNA metrics. We further examine how these choices influence the relationship between sRNAs and the critical feature of TE age, and contrast their effect on low copy genomic regions and other popular HTS data.,Based on our analyses, we share a series of take-home messages that may help with the design, implementation, and interpretation of high-throughput TE epigenetic studies specifically, but our conclusions may also apply to any work that involves analysis of HTS data.","15 February 2017","Transposable elements,Small RNAs,High-throughput sequencing,siRNAs,Genome mapping,Annotation,Bioinformatics,RNA-seq","alexandros.bousios@gmail.com","Alexandros Bousios."

Among them is Gallus gallus endogenous retrovirus 10 (GGERV10), one of the youngest endogenous retrovirus families, which emerged in the chicken genome around 3 million years ago.,We identified a total of 593 GGERV10 elements in the chicken reference genome using UCSC genome database and RepeatMasker. While most of the elements were truncated, 49 GGERV10 elements were full-length retaining 5′ and 3′ LTRs. We examined in detail their structural features, chromosomal distribution, genomic environment, and phylogenetic relationships. We compared LTR sequence among five different GGERV10 subfamilies and found sequence variations among the LTRs. Using a traditional PCR assay, we examined a polymorphism rate of the 49 full-length GGERV10 elements in three different chicken populations of the Korean domestic chicken, Leghorn, and Araucana. The result found a breed-specific GGERV10B insertion locus in the Korean domestic chicken, which could be used as a Korean domestic chicken-specific marker.,GGERV10 family is the youngest ERV family and thus might have contributed to recent genomic variations in different chicken populations. The result of this study showed that one of GGERV10 elements integrated into the chicken genome after the divergence of Korean domestic chicken from other closely related chicken populations, suggesting that GGERV10 could be served as a molecular marker for chicken breed identification.","24 January 2017","Retrotransposon,Full-length GGERV10,Genomic variation,Molecular marker,Incomplete lineage sorting","kyudong.han@gmail.com","Kyudong Han."

                           Mutator-like transposable elements (MULEs) are widespread with members in fungi, plants, and animals. Most of the research on the MULE superfamily has focused on plant MULEs where they were discovered and where some are extremely active and have significant impact on genome structure. The maize MuDR element has been widely used as a tool for both forward and reverse genetic studies because of its high transposition rate and preference for targeting genic regions. However, despite being widespread, only a few active MULEs have been identified, and only one, the rice Os3378, has demonstrated activity in a non-host organism.,Here we report the identification of potentially active MULEs in the mosquito Aedes aegypti. We demonstrate that one of these, Muta1, is capable of excision and reinsertion in a yeast transposition assay. Element reinsertion generated either 8 bp or 9 bp target site duplications (TSDs) with no apparent sequence preference. Mutagenesis analysis of donor site TSDs in the yeast assay indicates that their presence is important for precise excision and enhanced transposition. Site directed mutagenesis of the putative DDE catalytic motif and other conserved residues in the transposase protein abolished transposition activity.,Collectively, our data indicates that the Muta1 transposase of Ae. aegypti can efficiently catalyze both excision and reinsertion reactions in yeast. Mutagenesis analysis reveals that several conserved amino acids, including the DDE triad, play important roles in transposase function.

HERVs have been shown to generate RNAs that modulate host gene expression. However, experimental evidence for an impact of these regulatory transcripts on the cellular phenotype has been lacking.,We characterized the previously little described HERV-K(HML-10) endogenous retrovirus family on a genome-wide scale. HML-10 invaded the ancestral genome of Old World monkeys about 35 Million years ago and is enriched within introns of human genes when compared to other HERV families. We show that long terminal repeats (LTRs) of HML-10 exhibit variable promoter activity in human cancer cell lines. One identified HML-10 LTR-primed RNA was in opposite orientation to the pro-apoptotic Death-associated protein 3 (DAP3). In HeLa cells, experimental inactivation of HML-10 LTR-primed transcripts induced DAP3 expression levels, which led to apoptosis.,Its enrichment within introns suggests that HML-10 may have been evolutionary co-opted for gene regulation more than other HERV families. We demonstrated such a regulatory activity for an HML-10 RNA that suppressed DAP3-mediated apoptosis in HeLa cells. Since HML-10 RNA appears to be upregulated in various tumor cell lines and primary tumor samples, it may contribute to evasion of apoptosis in malignant cells. However, the overall weak expression of HML-10 transcripts described here raises the question whether our result described for HeLa represent a rare event in cancer.

Aberrant expression of coding genes or long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) with oncogenic properties can be caused by translocations, gene amplifications, point mutations or other less characterized mechanisms. One such mechanism is the inappropriate usage of normally dormant, tissue-restricted or cryptic enhancers or promoters that serve to drive oncogenic gene expression. Dispersed across the human genome, endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) provide an enormous reservoir of autonomous gene regulatory modules, some of which have been co-opted by the host during evolution to play important roles in normal regulation of genes and gene networks. This review focuses on the “dark side” of such ERV regulatory capacity. Specifically, we discuss a growing number of examples of normally dormant or epigenetically repressed ERVs that have been harnessed to drive oncogenes in human cancer, a process we term onco-exaptation, and we propose potential mechanisms that may underlie this phenomenon.","01 December 2016","Gene regulation,Endogenous retrovirus,Long terminal repeat,Retrotransposon,Epigenetics,Cancer,Alternative promoter,Exaptation,Transcription","dmager@bccrc.ca","Dixie L.

Due to increasing clinical interest in the roles of L1 in cancer, embryogenesis and neuronal development, it has become a priority to understand L1-host interactions and identify host factors required for its activity. Apropos to this, we recently reported that L1 retrotransposition in HeLa cells requires phosphorylation of the L1 protein ORF1p at motifs targeted by host cell proline-directed protein kinases (PDPKs), which include the family of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Using two engineered L1 reporter assays, we continued our investigation into the roles of MAPKs in L1 activity.,We found that the MAPK p38δ phosphorylated ORF1p on three of its four PDPK motifs required for L1 activity. In addition, we found that a constitutively active p38δ mutant appeared to promote L1 retrotransposition in HeLa cells. However, despite the consistency of these findings with our earlier work, we identified some technical concerns regarding the experimental methodology. Specifically, we found that exogenous expression of p38δ appeared to affect at least one heterologous promoter in an engineered L1 reporter, as well as generate opposing effects on two different reporters. We also show that two commercially available non-targeting control (NTC) siRNAs elicit drastically different effects on the apparent retrotransposition reported by both L1 assays, which raises concerns about the use of NTCs as normalizing controls.,Engineered L1 reporter assays have been invaluable for determining the functions and critical residues of L1 open reading frames, as well as elucidating many aspects of L1 replication. However, our results suggest that caution is required when interpreting data obtained from L1 reporters used in conjunction with exogenous gene expression or siRNA.","22 November 2016","L1,LINE-1,Reporter,Host factor,p38,HSV-TK,SV40,Promoter,Renilla","pamela.cook@nih.gov","Pamela R.

SNP 6.0 microarray analysis revealed deletions or loss of heterozygosity in the tumor genomes over the intervals corresponding to these LINE-1 insertions.,These findings indicate that LINE-1 retrotransposon can act as an infrequent insertional mutagen in secondary GBM, but that retrotransposition is uncommon in these central nervous system tumors as compared to other neoplasias.","11 November 2016","LINE-1,Retrotransposition,Cancer,Glioblastoma","jef.boeke@nyumc.org,kburns@jhmi.edu","Jef D.

Notably, cancer cells can support unusual L1 retrotransposition and L1-associated sequence rearrangement mechanisms following DNA damage. Recent reports suggest that L1 is mobile in epithelial tumours and neural cells but, paradoxically, not in brain cancers.,Here, using retrotransposon capture sequencing (RC-seq), we surveyed L1 mutations in 14 tumours classified as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) or as a lower grade glioma. In four GBM tumours, we characterised one probable endonuclease-independent L1 insertion, two L1-associated rearrangements and one likely Alu-Alu recombination event adjacent to an L1. These mutations included PCR validated intronic events in MeCP2 and EGFR. Despite sequencing L1 integration sites at up to 250× depth by RC-seq, we found no tumour-specific, endonuclease-dependent L1 insertions. Whole genome sequencing analysis of the tumours carrying the MeCP2 and EGFR L1 mutations also revealed no endonuclease-dependent L1 insertions. In a complementary in vitro assay, wild-type and endonuclease mutant L1 reporter constructs each mobilised very inefficiently in four cultured GBM cell lines.,These experiments altogether highlight the consistent absence of canonical L1 retrotransposition in GBM tumours and cultured cell lines, as well as atypical L1-associated sequence rearrangements following DNA damage in vivo.","11 November 2016","Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor,Lock Nucleic Acid,Adjacent Brain,Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Exon,Copy Number Amplification","paul.brennan@ed.ac.uk,faulknergj@gmail.com","Paul M.

Genome-wide studies of the complete panel have included exome sequencing, karyotyping, and copy number analyses but have not targeted repetitive sequences. Interspersed repeats derived from mobile DNAs are a significant source of heritable genetic variation, and insertions of active elements can occur somatically in malignancy.,We used Transposon Insertion Profiling by microarray (TIP-chip) to map Long INterspersed Element-1 (LINE-1, L1) and Alu Short INterspersed Element (SINE) insertions in cancer genes in NCI-60 cells. We focused this discovery effort on annotated Cancer Gene Index loci.,We catalogued a total of 749 and 2,100 loci corresponding to candidate LINE-1 and Alu insertion sites, respectively. As expected, these numbers encompass previously known insertions, polymorphisms shared in unrelated tumor cell lines, as well as unique, potentially tumor-specific insertions. We also conducted association analyses relating individual insertions to a variety of cellular phenotypes.,These data provide a resource for investigators with interests in specific cancer gene loci or mobile element insertion effects more broadly. Our data underscore that significant genetic variation in cancer genomes is owed to LINE-1 and Alu retrotransposons.

Graham and Kongming Wu","Retrotransposed genes are different to other types of genes as they originate from a processed mRNA and are then inserted back into the genome. For a long time, the contribution of this mechanism to the origin of new genes, and hence to the evolutionary process, has been questioned as retrogenes usually lose their regulatory sequences upon insertion and generally decay into pseudogenes. In recent years, there is growing evidence, notably in mammals, that retrotransposition is an important process driving the origin of new genes, but the evidence in insects remains largely restricted to a few model species.,By sequencing the messenger RNA of three developmental stages (first and fifth instar larvae and adults) of the pest Helicoverpa armigera, we identified a second, intronless, long-wavelength sensitive opsin (that we called LWS2). We then amplified the partial CDS of LWS2 retrogenes from another six noctuid moths, and investigate the phylogenetic distribution of LWS2 in 15 complete Lepidoptera and 1 Trichoptera genomes. Our results suggests that LWS2 evolved within the noctuid. Furthermore, we found that all the LWS2 opsins have an intact ORF, and have an ω-value (ω = 0.08202) relatively higher compared to their paralog LWS1 (ω = 0.02536), suggesting that LWS2 opsins were under relaxed purifying selection. Finally, the LWS2 shows temporal compartmentalization of expression. LWS2 in H. armigera in adult is expressed at a significantly lower level compared to all other opsins in adults; while in the in 1st instar stage larvae, it is expressed at a significantly higher level compared to other opsins.,Together the results of our evolutionary sequence analyses and gene expression data suggest that LWS2 is a functional gene, however, the relatively low level of expression in adults suggests that LWS2 is most likely not involved in mediating the visual process.","19 October 2016","Gene duplication,Expression,Evolution,Noctuidae","kmwu@ippcaas.cn","Kongming Wu."
"243","Convergent evolution of tRNA gene targeting preferences in compact genomes","Thomas Spaller, Eva Kling, Gernot Glöckner, Falk Hillmann and Thomas Winckler","In gene-dense genomes, mobile elements are confronted with highly selective pressure to amplify without causing excessive damage to the host. The targeting of tRNA genes as potentially safe integration sites has been developed by retrotransposons in various organisms such as the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In D. discoideum, tRNA gene-targeting retrotransposons have expanded to approximately 3 % of the genome. Recently obtained genome sequences of species representing the evolutionary history of social amoebae enabled us to determine whether the targeting of tRNA genes is a generally successful strategy for mobile elements to colonize compact genomes.,During the evolution of dictyostelids, different retrotransposon types independently developed the targeting of tRNA genes at least six times. DGLT-A elements are long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons that display integration preferences ~15 bp upstream of tRNA gene-coding regions reminiscent of the yeast Ty3 element. Skipper elements are chromoviruses that have developed two subgroups: one has canonical chromo domains that may favor integration in centromeric regions, whereas the other has diverged chromo domains and is found ~100 bp downstream of tRNA genes. The integration of D. discoideum non-LTR retrotransposons ~50 bp upstream (TRE5 elements) and ~100 bp downstream (TRE3 elements) of tRNA genes, respectively, likely emerged at the root of dictyostelid evolution. We identified two novel non-LTR retrotransposons unrelated to TREs: one with a TRE5-like integration behavior and the other with preference ~4 bp upstream of tRNA genes.,Dictyostelid retrotransposons demonstrate convergent evolution of tRNA gene targeting as a probable means to colonize the compact genomes of their hosts without being excessively mutagenic. However, high copy numbers of tRNA gene-associated retrotransposons, such as those observed in D. discoideum, are an exception, suggesting that the targeting of tRNA genes does not necessarily favor the amplification of position-specific integrating elements to high copy numbers under the repressive conditions that prevail in most host cells.","31 August 2016","

This review examines the strategies the cell has evolved to coexist with these genomic “parasites”, focussing on the non-long terminal repeat retrotransposons of humans and mice. Some of the restriction factors for retrotransposition, including the APOBECs, MOV10, RNASEL, SAMHD1, TREX1, and ZAP, also limit replication of retroviruses, including HIV, and are part of the intrinsic immune system of the cell. Many of these proteins act in the cytoplasm to degrade retroelement RNA or inhibit its translation. Some factors act in the nucleus and involve DNA repair enzymes or epigenetic processes of DNA methylation and histone modification. RISC and piRNA pathway proteins protect the germline. Retrotransposon control is relaxed in some cell types, such as neurons in the brain, stem cells, and in certain types of disease and cancer, with implications for human health and disease. This review also considers potential pitfalls in interpreting retrotransposon-related data, as well as issues to consider for future research.","11 August 2016","Alu,Autoimmunity,Epigenetics,LINE-1,Methylation,Restriction,Retrovirus,RNAi,SINE,SVA","jgoodier@jhmi.edu","John L.

SVA (SINE-R/VNTR/Alu) is the youngest retrotransposon family in the human genome and a number of diseases are known to be caused by SVA insertions. However, inter-individual genomic variations generated by SVA insertions and their impacts have not been studied extensively due to the difficulty in identifying polymorphic SVA insertions.,To systematically identify SVA insertions at the population level and assess their genomic impact, we developed a mobile element scanning (ME-Scan) protocol we called ME-Scan-SVA. Using a nested SVA-specific PCR enrichment method, ME-Scan-SVA selectively amplify the 5′ end of SVA elements and their flanking genomic regions. To demonstrate the utility of the protocol, we constructed and sequenced a ME-Scan-SVA library of 21 individuals and analyzed the data using a new analysis pipeline designed for the protocol. Overall, the method achieved high SVA-specificity and over >90 % of the sequenced reads are from SVA insertions. The method also had high sensitivity (>90 %) for fixed SVA insertions that contain the SVA-specific primer-binding sites in the reference genome. Using candidate locus selection criteria that are expected to have a 90 % sensitivity, we identified 151 and 29 novel polymorphic SVA candidates under relaxed and stringent cutoffs, respectively (average 12 and 2 per individual). For six polymorphic SVAs that we were able to validate by PCR, the average individual genotype accuracy is 92 %, demonstrating a high accuracy of the computational genotype calling pipeline.,The new approach allows identifying novel SVA insertions using high-throughput sequencing. It is cost-effective and can be applied in large-scale population study. It also can be applied for detecting potential active SVA elements, and somatic SVA retrotransposition events in different tissues or developmental stages.","30 July 2016","SVA,Retrotransposon,High-throughput sequencing,ME-Scan","xing@biology.rutgers.edu","Jinchuan Xing."
"246","Virus-like attachment sites as structural landmarks of plants retrotransposons","Edgar Andres Ochoa Cruz, Guilherme Marcello Queiroga Cruz, Andréia Prata Vieira and Marie-Anne Van Sluys","The genomic data available nowadays has enabled the study of repetitive sequences and their relationship to viruses. Among them, long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) are the largest component of most plant genomes, the Gypsy and Copia superfamilies being the most common. Recently it has been found that Del lineage, an LTR-RT of Gypsy superfamily, has putative virus-like attachment (vl-att) sites. This signature, originally described for retroviruses, is recognized by retroviral integrase conferring specificity to the integration process.,Here we retrieved 26,092 putative complete LTR-RTs from 10 lineages found in 10 fully sequenced angiosperm genomes and found putative vl-att sites that are a conserved structural landmark across these genomes. Furthermore, we reveal that each plant genome has a distinguishable LTR-RT lineage amplification pattern that could be related to the vl-att sites diversity. We used these patterns to generate a specific quick-response (QR) code for each genome that could be used as a barcode of identification of plants in the future.,The universal distribution of vl-att sites represents a new structural feature common to plant LTR-RTs and retroviruses. This is an important finding that expands the information about the structural similarity between LTR-RT and retroviruses. We speculate that the sequence diversity of vl-att sites could be important for the life cycle of retrotransposons, as it was shown for retroviruses. All the structural vl-att site signatures are strong candidates for further functional studies. Moreover, this is the first identification of specific LTR-RT content and their amplification patterns in a large dataset of LTR-RT lineages and angiosperm genomes. These distribution patterns could be used in the future with biotechnological identification purposes.","28 July 2016","LTR-RTs,Angiosperm genomes,

Ray","Around 40 million years ago DNA transposons began accumulating in an ancestor of bats in the family Vespertilionidae. Since that time, Class II transposons have been continuously reinvading and accumulating in vespertilionid genomes at a rate that is unprecedented in mammals. Miniopterus (Miniopteridae), a genus of long-fingered bats that was recently elevated from Vespertilionidae, is the sister taxon to the vespertilionids and is often used as an outgroup when studying transposable elements in vesper bats. Previous wet-lab techniques failed to identify Helitrons, TcMariners, or hAT transposons in Miniopterus. Limitations of those methods and ambiguous results regarding the distribution of piggyBac transposons left some questions as to the distribution of Class II elements in this group. The recent release of the Miniopterus natalensis genome allows for transposable element discovery with a higher degree of precision.,Here we analyze the transposable element content of M. natalensis to pinpoint with greater accuracy the taxonomic distribution of Class II transposable elements in bats. These efforts demonstrate that, compared to the vespertilionids, Class II TEs are highly mutated and comprise only a small portion of the M. natalensis genome. Despite the limited Class II content, M. natalensis possesses a limited number of lineage-specific, low copy number piggyBacs and shares several TcMariner families with vespertilionid bats. Multiple efforts to identify Helitrons, one of the major TE components of vesper bat genomes, using de novo repeat identification and structural based searches failed.,These observations combined with previous results inform our understanding of the events leading to the unique Class II element acquisition that characterizes vespertilionids. While it appears that a small number of TcMariner and piggyBac elements were deposited in the ancestral Miniopterus + vespertilionid genome, these elements are not present in M. natalensis genome at high copy number. Instead, this work indicates that the vesper bats alone experienced the expansion of TEs ranging from Helitrons to piggyBacs to hATs.","22 July 2016","Miniopteridae,Vespertilionidae,TcMariner,Helitron,Transposable element","david.4.ray@gmail.com","David A.

"249","Distribution of the DNA transposon family, Pokey in the Daphnia pulex species complex","Shannon H. C. Eagle and Teresa J. Crease","The Pokey family of DNA transposons consists of two putatively autonomous groups, PokeyA and PokeyB, and two groups of Miniature Inverted-repeat Transposable Elements (MITEs), mPok1 and mPok2. This TE family is unusual as it inserts into a specific site in ribosomal (r)DNA, as well as other locations in Daphnia genomes. The goals of this study were to determine the distribution of the Pokey family in lineages of the Daphnia pulex species complex, and to test the hypothesis that unusally high PokeyA number in some isolates of Daphnia pulicaria is the result of recent transposition. To do this, we estimated the haploid number of Pokey, mPok, and rRNA genes in 45 isolates from five Daphnia lineages using quantitative PCR. We also cloned and sequenced partial copies of PokeyA from four isolates of D. pulicaria.,Haploid PokeyA and PokeyB number is generally less than 20 and tends to be higher outside rDNA in four lineages. Conversely, the number of both groups is much higher outside rDNA (~120) in D. arenata, and PokeyB is also somewhat higher inside rDNA. mPok1 was only detected in D. arenata. mPok2 occurs both outside (~30) and inside rDNA (~6) in D. arenata, but was rare (≤2) outside rDNA in the other four lineages. There is no correlation between Pokey and rRNA gene number (mean = 240 across lineages) in any lineage. Variation among cloned partial PokeyA sequences is significantly higher in isolates with high number compared to isolates with an average number.,The high Pokey number outside rDNA in D. arenata and inside rDNA in some D. pulicaria isolates is consistent with a recent increase in transposition rate. The D. pulicaria increase may have been triggered by insertion of PokeyA into a region of transcriptionally active rDNA. The expansion in D. arenata (thought to be of hybrid origin) may be a consequence of release from epigenetic repression following hybridization. Previous work found D. obtusa to be very different from the D. pulex complex; mean PokeyA is higher in rDNA (~75), rDNA array size is nearly twice as large (415), and the two are positively correlated. The predominance of Pokey in only one location could be explained by purifying selection against ectopic recombination between elements inside and outside rDNA.","17 June 2016","

Since the availability of whole genomes, genomic analyses have provided novel insights into retrotransposon biology. However, many retrotransposon families and their possible genomic impact have not yet been analysed.,Here, we analysed the structural features, the genomic distribution and the evolutionary history of mouse VL30 LTR-retrotransposons. In total, we identified 372 VL30 sequences categorized as 86 full-length and 49 truncated copies as well as 237 solo LTRs, with non-random chromosomal distribution. Full-length VL30s were highly conserved elements with intact retroviral replication signals, but with no protein-coding capacity. Analysis of LTRs revealed a high number of common transcription factor binding sites, possibly explaining the known inducible and tissue-specific expression of individual elements. The overwhelming majority of full-length and truncated elements (82/86 and 40/49, respectively) contained one or two specific motifs required for binding of the VL30 RNA to the poly-pyrimidine tract-binding protein-associated splicing factor (PSF). Phylogenetic analysis revealed three VL30 groups with the oldest emerging ~17.5 Myrs ago, while the other two were characterized mostly by new genomic integrations. Most VL30 sequences were found integrated either near, adjacent or inside transcription start sites, or into introns or at the 3′ end of genes. In addition, a significant number of VL30s were found near Krueppel-associated box (KRAB) genes functioning as potent transcriptional repressors.,Collectively, our study provides data on VL30s related to their: (a) number and structural features involved in their transcription that play a role in steroidogenesis and oncogenesis; (b) evolutionary history and potential for retrotransposition; and (c) unique genomic distribution and impact on gene expression.","06 May 2016","VL30s,Retrotransposon,PSF,Mouse genome,Exaptation","thtzavar@cc.uoi.gr","Theodore Tzavaras."

To date in humans, 124 LINE-1-mediated insertions which result in genetic diseases have been reported. Disease causing LINE-1 insertions have provided a wealth of insight and the foundation for valuable tools to study these genomic parasites.

Smither and Victoria P. Belancio","Approximately 17 % of the human genome is comprised of the Long INterspersed Element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) retrotransposon, the only currently active autonomous family of retroelements. Though L1 elements have helped to shape mammalian genome evolution over millions of years, L1 activity can also be mutagenic and result in human disease. L1 expression has the potential to contribute to genomic instability via retrotransposition and DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Additionally, L1 is responsible for structural genomic variations induced by other transposable elements such as Alu and SVA, which rely on the L1 ORF2 protein for their propagation. Most of the genomic damage associated with L1 activity originates with the endonuclease domain of the ORF2 protein, which nicks the DNA in preparation for target-primed reverse transcription.,Bioinformatic analysis of full-length L1 loci residing in the human genome identified numerous mutations in the amino acid sequence of the ORF2 endonuclease domain. Some of these mutations were found in residues which were predicted to be phosphorylation sites for cellular kinases. We mutated several of these putative phosphorylation sites in the ORF2 endonuclease domain and investigated the effect of these mutations on the function of the full-length ORF2 protein and the endonuclease domain (ENp) alone. Most of the single and multiple point mutations that were tested did not significantly impact expression of the full-length ORF2p, or alter its ability to drive Alu retrotransposition. Similarly, most of those same mutations did not significantly alter expression of ENp, or impair its ability to induce DNA damage and cause toxicity.,Overall, our data demonstrate that the full-length ORF2p or the ENp alone can tolerate several specific single and multiple point mutations in the endonuclease domain without significant impairment of their ability to support Alu mobilization or induce DNA damage, respectively.","19 April 2016","LINE-1,L1,ORF2,Endonuclease,Mutation,Retrotransposition,Phosphorylation","vperepe@tulane.edu","Victoria P.

Very recent inserts are polymorphic within and between human populations. In a sample of 30 elements originating from three different Alu subfamilies, we investigated whether they are preserved in prehistorical skeletal human remains from the Bronze Age Lichtenstein cave in Lower Saxony, Germany. In the present study, we examined a prehistoric triad of father, mother and daughter.,For 26 of the 30 Alu loci investigated, definite results were obtained. We were able to demonstrate that presence/absence analyses of Alu elements can be conducted on individuals who lived 3,000 years ago. The preservation of the ancient DNA (aDNA) is good enough in two out of three ancient individuals to routinely allow the amplification of 500 bp fragments. The third individual revealed less well-preserved DNA, which results in allelic dropout or complete amplification failures. We here present an alternative molecular approach to deal with these degradation phenomena by using internal Alu subfamily specific primers producing short fragments of approximately 150 bp.,Our data clearly show the possibility of presence/absence analyses of Alu elements in individuals from the Lichtenstein cave. Thus, we demonstrate that our method is reliably applicable for aDNA samples with good or moderate DNA preservation. This method will be very useful for further investigations with more Alu loci and larger datasets. Human population genetic studies and other large-scale investigations would provide insight into Alu SINE-based microevolutionary processes in humans during the last few thousand years and help us comprehend the evolutionary dynamics of our genome.","18 April 2016","Transposable elements,

Transposable elements (TEs) represent the most abundant component of many eukaryotic genomes. Mobile elements are a driving force of eukaryotic genome evolution. McClintock’s Ac, the autonomous element of the Ac/Ds system, together with hobo from Drosophila and Tam3 from snapdragon define an ancient and diverse DNA transposon superfamily named hAT. Other members of the hAT superfamily include the insect element Hermes and Tol2 from medaka. In recent years, genetic tools derived from the ‘cut’ and ‘paste’ Tol2 DNA transposon have been widely used for genomic manipulation in zebrafish, mammals and in cells in vitro.,We report the purification of a functional recombinant Tol2 protein from E.coli. We demonstrate here that following microinjection using a zebrafish embryo test system, purified Tol2 transposase protein readily catalyzes gene transfer in both somatic and germline tissues in vivo. We show that purified Tol2 transposase can promote both in vitro cutting and pasting in a defined system lacking other cellular factors. Notably, our analysis of Tol2 transposition in vitro reveals that the target site preference observed for Tol2 in complex host genomes is maintained using a simpler target plasmid test system, indicating that the primary sequence might encode intrinsic cues for transposon integration.,This active Tol2 protein is an important new tool for diverse applications including gene discovery and molecular medicine, as well as for the biochemical analysis of transposition and regulation of hAT transposon/genome interactions. The measurable but comparatively modest insertion site selection bias noted for Tol2 is largely determined by the primary sequence encoded in the target sequence as assessed through studying Tol2 protein-mediated transposition in a cell-free system.","31 March 2016","

The cause of the difference in genome size remains largely unexplained.,In this study, we reveal that the differential success of transposable elements (TEs) correlates with the variation of genome size across four representative teleost species (zebrafish, medaka, stickleback, and tetraodon). The larger genomes represent a higher diversity within each clade (superfamily) and family and a greater abundance of TEs compared with the smaller genomes; zebrafish, representing the largest genome, shows the highest diversity and abundance of TEs in its genome, followed by medaka and stickleback; while the tetraodon, representing the most compact genome, displays the lowest diversity and density of TEs in its genome. Both of Class I (retrotransposons) and Class II TEs (DNA transposons) contribute to the difference of TE accumulation of teleost genomes, however, Class II TEs are the major component of the larger teleost genomes analyzed and the most important contributors to genome size variation across teleost lineages. The hAT and Tc1/Mariner superfamilies are the major DNA transposons of all four investigated teleosts. Divergence distribution revealed contrasting proliferation dynamics both between clades of retrotransposons and between species. The TEs within the larger genomes of the zebrafish and medaka represent relatively stronger activity with an extended time period during the evolution history, in contrast with the very young activity in the smaller stickleback genome, or the very low level of activity in the tetraodon genome.,Overall, our data shows that teleosts represent contrasting profiles of mobilomes with a differential density, diversity and activity of TEs. The differences in TE accumulation, dominated by DNA transposons, explain the main size variations of genomes across the investigated teleost species, and the species differences in both diversity and activity of TEs contributed to the variations of TE accumulations across the four teleost species. TEs play major roles in teleost genome evolution.","09 February 2016","Transposable elements,Teleosts,Genome size evolution,Activity,Diversity","hmcui@yzu.edu.cn,chengyilab@hotmail.com","Hengmi Cui or Chengyi Song."
"257","Genome ARTIST: a robust, high-accuracy aligner tool for mapping transposon insertions and self-insertions","Alexandru Al. Ecovoiu, Iulian Constantin Ghionoiu, Andrei Mihai Ciuca and Attila Cristian Ratiu","A critical topic of insertional mutagenesis experiments performed on model organisms is mapping the hits of artificial transposons (ATs) at nucleotide level accuracy. Mapping errors may occur when sequencing artifacts or mutations as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small indels are present very close to the junction between a genomic sequence and a transposon inverted repeat (TIR). Another particular item of insertional mutagenesis is mapping of the transposon self-insertions and, to our best knowledge, there is no publicly available mapping tool designed to analyze such molecular events.,We developed Genome ARTIST, a pairwise gapped aligner tool which works out both issues by means of an original, robust mapping strategy. Genome ARTIST is not designed to use next-generation sequencing (NGS) data but to analyze ATs insertions obtained in small to medium-scale mutagenesis experiments. Genome ARTIST employs a heuristic approach to find DNA sequence similarities and harnesses a multi-step implementation of a Smith-Waterman adapted algorithm to compute the mapping alignments. The experience is enhanced by easily customizable parameters and a user-friendly interface that describes the genomic landscape surrounding the insertion. Genome ARTIST is functional with many genomes of bacteria and eukaryotes available in Ensembl and GenBank repositories. Our tool specifically harnesses the sequence annotation data provided by FlyBase for Drosophila melanogaster (the fruit fly), which enables mapping of insertions relative to various genomic features such as natural transposons. Genome ARTIST was tested against other alignment tools using relevant query sequences derived from the D. melanogaster and Mus musculus (mouse) genomes. Real and simulated query sequences were also comparatively inquired, revealing that Genome ARTIST is a very robust solution for mapping transposon insertions.,Genome ARTIST is a stand-alone user-friendly application, designed for high-accuracy mapping of transposon insertions and self-insertions. The tool is also useful for routine aligning assessments like detection of SNPs or checking the specificity of primers and probes. Genome ARTIST is an open source software and is available for download at www.genomeartist.ro and at GitHub (https://github.com/genomeartist/genomeartist ).","05 February 2016","Transposon mapping,Artificial transposons,Transposon inverted repeat,Self-insertion,

Landweber","Transposable elements are a major player contributing to genetic variation and shaping genome evolution. Multiple independent transposon domestication events have occurred in ciliates, recruiting transposases to key roles in cellular processes. In the ciliate Oxytricha trifallax, the telomere-bearing elements (TBE), a Tc1/mariner transposon, occupy a significant portion of the germline genome and are involved in programmed genome rearrangements that produce a transcriptionally active somatic nucleus from a copy of the germline nucleus during development.,Here we provide a thorough characterization of the distribution and sequences of TBE transposons in the Oxytricha germline genome. We annotate more than 10,000 complete and 24,000 partial TBE sequences. TBEs cluster into four major families and display a preference for either insertion into DNA segments that are retained in the somatic genome or their maintenance at such sites. The three TBE-encoded genes in all four families display dN/dS ratios much lower than 1, suggesting genome-wide purifying selection. We also identify TBE homologs in other ciliate species for phylogenomic analysis.,This paper provides genome-wide characterization of a major class of ciliate transposons. Phylogenomic analysis reveals selective constraints on transposon-encoded genes, shedding light on the evolution and domesticated functions of these transposons.","25 January 2016","Transposable element,Transposon domestication,Ciliates,Genome rearrangement,Purifying selection","lfl@princeton.edu","Laura F.

Therefore, further analysis of retrotransposons will enhance our understanding of the evolutionary history of Pyrus.,We identified 1836 LTR-retrotransposons in the ‘Suli’ pear genome, of which 440 LTR-retrotransposons were predicted to contain at least two of three gene models (gag, integrase and reverse transcriptase). Because these were most likely to be functional transposons, we focused our analyses on this set of 440. Most of the LTR-retrotransposons were estimated to have inserted into the genome less than 2.5 million years ago. Sequence analysis showed that the reverse transcriptase component of the identified LTR-retrotransposons was highly heterogeneous. Analyses of transcripts assembled from RNA-Seq databases of two cultivars of Pyrus species showed that LTR-retrotransposons were expressed in the buds and fruit of Pyrus. A total of 734 coding sequences in the ‘Suli’ genome were disrupted by the identified LTR-retrotransposons. Five high-copy-number LTR-retrotransposon families were identified in Pyrus. These families were rarely found in the genomes of Malus and Prunus, but were distributed extensively in Pyrus and abundance varied between species.,We identified potentially functional, full-length LTR-retrotransposons with three gene models in the ‘Suli’ genome. The analysis of RNA-seq data demonstrated that these retrotransposons are expressed in the organs of pears. The differential copy number of LTR-retrotransposon families between Pyrus species suggests that the transposition of retrotransposons is an important evolutionary force driving the genetic divergence of species within the genus.","15 January 2016","Retrotransposons,Insertion time,Distribution,Genetic diversity,

However, most Helitrons lack protein coding sequence. These non-autonomous elements are thought to hijack recombinase/helicase (RepHel) and possibly further enzymes from related, autonomous elements. Interestingly, many plant Helitrons contain an additional gene encoding a single-strand binding protein homologous to Replication Factor A (RPA), a highly conserved, single-copy gene found in all eukaryotes.,Here, we describe the analysis of DHH_Mothra, a high-copy non-autonomous Helitron in the genome of rice (Oryza sativa). Mothra has a low GC-content and consists of two distinct blocs of tandem repeats. Based on homology between their termini, we identified a putative mother element which encodes an RPA-like protein but has no RepHel gene. Additionally, we found a putative autonomous sister-family with strong homology to the Mothra mother element in the RPA protein and terminal sequences, which we propose provides the RepHel domain for the Mothra family. Furthermore, we phylogenetically analyzed the evolutionary history of RPA-like proteins. Interestingly, plant Helitron RPAs (PHRPAs) are only found in monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants and they form a monophyletic group which branched off before the eukaryotic “core” RPAs.,Our data show how erosion of autonomous Helitrons can lead to different “levels” of autonomy within Helitron families and can create highly successful subfamilies of non-autonomous elements. Most importantly, our phylogenetic analysis showed that the PHRPA gene was most likely acquired via horizontal gene transfer from an unknown eukaryotic donor at least 145–300 million years ago in the common ancestor of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants. This might have led to the evolution of a separate branch of the Helitron superfamily in plants.","17 December 2015","Transposon,Helitron,RPA,Rice,Horizontal transfer","wicker@botinst.uzh.ch","Thomas Wicker."

Surprisingly, a significant number of chromosomal genes required for Ty1 transposition encode components of the translational machinery, including ribosomal proteins, ribosomal biogenesis factors, protein trafficking proteins and protein or RNA modification enzymes.,To assess the mechanistic connection between Ty1 mobility and the translation machinery, we have determined the effect of these mutations on ribosome biogenesis and Ty1 transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. Lack of genes encoding ribosomal proteins or ribosome assembly factors causes reduced accumulation of the ribosomal subunit with which they are associated. In addition, these mutations cause decreased Ty1 + 1 programmed translational frameshifting, and reduced Gag protein accumulation despite at least normal levels of Ty1 mRNA. Several ribosome subunit mutations increase the level of both an internally initiated Ty1 transcript and its encoded truncated Gag-p22 protein, which inhibits transposition.,Together, our results suggest that this large class of cellular genes modulate Ty1 transposition through multiple pathways. The effects are largely post-transcriptional acting at a variety of levels that may include translation initiation, protein stability and subcellular protein localization.","08 December 2015","Retrotransposition,Host factors,Programmed frameshifting,Ribosomal protein insufficiency,Ribosome biogenesis","farabaug@umbc.edu","Philip J.

King Jordan","The human genome contains several active families of transposable elements (TE): Alu, L1 and SVA. Germline transposition of these elements can lead to polymorphic TE (polyTE) loci that differ between individuals with respect to the presence/absence of TE insertions. Limited sets of such polyTE loci have proven to be useful as markers of ancestry in human population genetic studies, but until this time it has not been possible to analyze the full genomic complement of TE polymorphisms in this way.,For the first time here, we have performed a human population genetic analysis based on a genome-wide polyTE data set consisting of 16,192 loci genotyped in 2,504 individuals across 26 human populations. PolyTEs are found at very low frequencies, > 93 % of loci show < 5 % allele frequency, consistent with the deleteriousness of TE insertions. Nevertheless, polyTEs do show substantial geographic differentiation, with numerous group-specific polymorphic insertions. African populations have the highest numbers of polyTEs and show the highest levels of polyTE genetic diversity; Alu is the most numerous and the most diverse polyTE family. PolyTE genotypes were used to compute allele sharing distances between individuals and to relate them within and between human populations. Populations and continental groups show high coherence based on individuals’ polyTE genotypes, and human evolutionary relationships revealed by these genotypes are consistent with those seen for SNP-based genetic distances. The patterns of genetic diversity encoded by TE polymorphisms recapitulate broad patterns of human evolution and migration over the last 60–100,000 years. The utility of polyTEs as ancestry informative markers is further underscored by their ability to accurately predict both ancestry and admixture at the continental level. A genome-wide list of polyTE loci, along with their population group-specific allele frequencies and FST values, is provided as a resource for investigators who wish to develop panels of TE-based ancestry markers.,The genetic diversity represented by TE polymorphisms reflects known patterns of human evolution, and ensembles of polyTE loci are suitable for both ancestry and admixture analyses. The patterns of polyTE allelic diversity suggest the possibility that there may be a connection between TE-based genetic divergence and population-specific phenotypic differences.,ᅟ","16 November 2015","Transposable elements,Polymorphism,Population genetics,Human ancestry,Admixture,Ancestry informative markers,Phylogenetics,Alu,L1,SVA","king.jordan@biology.gatech.edu","I.

Schizosaccharomyces japonicus contains 10 families of Long Terminal Repeat (LTR)-retrotransposons and these elements cluster in centromeres and telomeres. In the related yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe LTR-retrotransposons Tf1 and Tf2 are distributed in the promoter regions of RNA pol II transcribed genes. Sequence analysis of TEs indicates that Tj1 of S. japonicus is related to Tf1 and Tf2, and uses the same mechanism of self-primed reverse transcription. Thus, we wondered why these related retrotransposons localized in different regions of the genome.,To characterize the integration behavior of Tj1 we expressed it in S. pombe. We found Tj1 was active and capable of generating de novo integration in the chromosomes of S. pombe. The expression of Tj1 is similar to Type C retroviruses in that a stop codon at the end of Gag must be present for efficient integration. 17 inserts were sequenced, 13 occurred within 12 bp upstream of tRNA genes and 3 occurred at other RNA pol III transcribed genes. The link between Tj1 integration and RNA pol III transcription is reminiscent of Ty3, an LTR-retrotransposon of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that interacts with TFIIIB and integrates upstream of tRNA genes.,The integration of Tj1 upstream of tRNA genes and the centromeric clustering of tRNA genes in S. japonicus demonstrate that the clustering of this TE in centromere sequences is due to a unique pattern of integration.","09 October 2015","Tj1,Long terminal repeat retrotransposon,

Such elements are known to be involved in transcriptional regulation, host-pathogen interactions and genome evolution.,We identified a minisatellite contained within a miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) in Porphyromonas gingivalis. The P. gingivalis minisatellite and associated MITE, named ‘BrickBuilt’, comprises a tandemly repeating twenty-three nucleotide DNA sequence lacking spacer regions between repeats, and with flanking ‘leader’ and ‘tail’ subunits that include small inverted-repeat ends. Forms of the BrickBuilt MITE are found 19 times in the genome of P. gingivalis strain ATCC 33277, and also multiple times within the strains W83, TDC60, HG66 and JCVI SC001. BrickBuilt is always located intergenically ranging between 49 and 591 nucleotides from the nearest upstream and downstream coding sequences. Segments of BrickBuilt contain promoter elements with bidirectional transcription capabilities.,We performed a bioinformatic analysis of BrickBuilt utilizing existing whole genome sequencing, microarray and RNAseq data, as well as performing in vitro promoter probe assays to determine potential roles, mechanisms and regulation of the expression of these elements and their affect on surrounding loci. The multiplicity, localization and limited host range nature of MITEs and MITE-like elements in P. gingivalis suggest that these elements may play an important role in facilitating genome evolution as well as modulating the transcriptional regulatory system.","06 October 2015","Species-specific repeat,DNA structure,Miniature Inverted-repeat Transposable Element,BrickBuilt,Transcriptional regulation,

Macfarlan","Tandem C2H2-type zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) constitute the largest transcription factor family in animals. Tandem-ZFPs bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner through arrays of multiple zinc finger domains that allow high flexibility and specificity in target recognition. In tetrapods, a large proportion of tandem-ZFPs contain Krüppel-associated-box (KRAB) repression domains, which are able to induce epigenetic silencing through the KAP1 corepressor. The KRAB-ZFP family continuously amplified in tetrapods through segmental gene duplications, often accompanied by deletions, duplications, and mutations of the zinc finger domains. As a result, tetrapod genomes contain unique sets of KRAB-ZFP genes, consisting of ancient and recently evolved family members. Although several hundred human and mouse KRAB-ZFPs have been identified or predicted, the biological functions of most KRAB-ZFP family members have gone unexplored. Furthermore, the evolutionary forces driving the extraordinary KRAB-ZFP expansion and diversification have remained mysterious for decades. In this review, we highlight recent studies that associate KRAB-ZFPs with the repression of parasitic DNA elements in the mammalian germ line and discuss the hypothesis that the KRAB-ZFP family primarily evolved as an adaptive genomic surveillance system against foreign DNA. Finally, we comment on the computational, genetic, and biochemical challenges of studying KRAB-ZFPs and attempt to predict how these challenges may be soon overcome.","02 October 2015","KRAB zinc finger proteins,Transcription factors,Endogenous retroviruses,Transposable elements,Epigenetic silencing,Adaptive evolution","todd.macfarlan@nih.gov","Todd S.

Here, we report the results of a comprehensive screen for EVEs in crustaceans. Following up on the recent discovery of EVEs in the terrestrial isopod, Armadillidium vulgare, we scanned the genomes of six crustacean species: a terrestrial isopod (Armadillidium nasatum), two water fleas (Daphnia pulex and D. pulicaria), two copepods (the salmon louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Eurytemora affinis), and a freshwater amphipod (Hyalella azteca).,In total, we found 210 EVEs representing 14 different lineages belonging to five different viral groups that are present in two to five species: Bunyaviridae (−ssRNA), Circoviridae (ssDNA), Mononegavirales (−ssRNA), Parvoviridae (ssDNA) and Totiviridae (dsRNA). The identification of shared orthologous insertions between A. nasatum and A. vulgare indicates that EVEs have been maintained over several millions of years, although we did not find any evidence supporting exaptation. Overall, the different degrees of EVE degradation (from none to >10 nonsense mutations) suggest that endogenization has been recurrent during the evolution of the various crustacean taxa. Our study is the first to report EVEs in D. pulicaria, E. affinis and H. azteca, many of which are likely to result from recent endogenization of currently circulating viruses.,In conclusion, we have unearthed a large diversity of EVEs from crustacean genomes, and shown that four of the five viral groups we uncovered (Bunyaviridae, Circoviridae, Mononegavirales, Parvoviridae) were and may still be present in three to four highly divergent crustacean taxa. In addition, the discovery of recent EVEs offers an interesting opportunity to characterize new exogenous viruses currently circulating in economically or ecologically important copepod species.","16 September 2015","Paleovirology,Endogenous viral elements,Virus,

Burckhalter, James M. Burnette III and C. Nathan Hancock","A key difference between the Tourist and Stowaway families of miniature inverted repeat transposable elements (MITEs) is the manner in which their excision alters the genome. Upon excision, Stowaway-like MITEs and the associated Mariner elements usually leave behind a small duplication and short sequences from the end of the element. These small insertions or deletions known as “footprints” can potentially disrupt coding or regulatory sequences. In contrast, Tourist-like MITEs and the associated PIF/Pong/Harbinger elements generally excise precisely, returning the genome to its original state. The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanisms underlying these excision differences, including the role of the host DNA repair mechanisms.,The transposition of the Tourist-like element, mPing, and the Stowaway-like element, 14T32, were evaluated using yeast transposition assays. Assays performed in yeast strains lacking non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) enzymes indicated that the excision sites of both elements were primarily repaired by NHEJ. Altering the target site duplication (TSD) sequences that flank these elements reduced the transposition frequency. Using yeast strains with the ability to repair the excision site by homologous repair showed that some TSD changes disrupt excision of the element. Changing the ends of mPing to produce non-matching TSDs drastically reduced repair of the excision site and resulted in increased generation of footprints.,Together these results indicate that the difference in Tourist and Stowaway excision sites results from transposition mechanism characteristics. The TSDs of both elements play a role in element excision, but only the mPing TSDs actively participate in excision site repair. Our data suggests that Tourist-like elements excise with staggered cleavage of the TSDs, which provides microhomology that facilitates precise repair. This slight modification in the transposition mechanism results in more efficient repair of the double stranded break, and thus, may be less harmful to host genomes by disrupting fewer genes.","07 September 2015","

The non-long terminal repeat retrotransposon TRE5-A amplifies continuously in D. discoideum cells even though it produces considerable amounts of minus-strand (antisense) RNA in the presence of an active RNA interference machinery. Removal of the host-encoded C-module-binding factor (CbfA) from D. discoideum cells resulted in a more than 90 % reduction of both plus- and minus-strand RNA of TRE5-A and a strong decrease of the retrotransposition activity of the cellular TRE5-A population. Transcriptome analysis revealed an approximately 230-fold overexpression of the gene coding for the Argonaute-like protein AgnC in a CbfA-depleted mutant.,The D. discoideum genome contains orthologs of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, Dicer-like proteins, and Argonaute proteins that are supposed to represent RNA interference pathways. We analyzed available mutants in these genes for altered expression of TRE5-A. We found that the retrotransposon was overexpressed in mutants lacking the Argonaute proteins AgnC and AgnE. Because the agnC gene is barely expressed in wild-type cells, probably due to repression by CbfA, we employed a new method of promoter-swapping to overexpress agnC in a CbfA-independent manner. In these strains we established an in vivo retrotransposition assay that determines the retrotransposition frequency of the cellular TRE5-A population. We observed that both the TRE5-A steady-state RNA level and retrotransposition rate dropped to less than 10 % of wild-type in the agnC overexpressor strains.,The data suggest that TRE5-A amplification is controlled by a distinct pathway of the Dictyostelium RNA interference machinery that does not require RNA-dependent RNA polymerases but involves AgnC. This control is at least partially overcome by the activity of CbfA, a factor derived from the retrotransposon’s host. This unusual regulation of mobile element activity most likely had a profound effect on genome evolution in D. discoideum.","03 September 2015","

This is especially interesting when one considers the increased transposable element diversity of vesper bats in general.,Our data suggest that survey sequencing and genome mining are valuable tools to investigate SINE evolution among related lineages and can provide substantial information about the ability of SINEs to proliferate in diverse genomes. This method would also be a useful first step in determining which subfamilies would be the best to target when developing SINEs as markers for phylogenetic and population genetic analyses.","15 May 2015","Genome Draft,Standard Deviation Range,Sine Family,Neutral Mutation Rate,Sine Insertion","david.4.ray@gmail.com","David A Ray."
"275","Mechanism of spacer integration links the CRISPR/Cas system to transposition as a form of mobile DNA","Fred Dyda and Alison B Hickman","It has recently become clear that many bacterial and archaeal species possess adaptive immune systems. These are typified by multiple copies of DNA sequences known as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs). These CRISPR repeats are the sites at which short spacers containing sequences of previously encountered foreign DNA are integrated, and the spacers serve as the molecular memory of previous invaders. In vivo work has demonstrated that two CRISPR-associated proteins - Cas1 and Cas2 - are required for spacer integration, but the mechanism by which this is accomplished remained unclear. Here we review a recent paper describing the in vitro reconstitution of CRISPR spacer integration using purified Cas1 and Cas2 and place the results in context of similar DNA transposition reactions and the crystal structure of the Cas1/Cas2 complex.","12 May 2015","CRISPR/Cas,Adaptive immunity,Cas1 nuclease protein,DNA transposition,Integrase","Fred.Dyda@nih.gov","Fred Dyda."
"276","Genome-wide comparison of Asian and African rice reveals high recent activity of DNA transposons","Stefan Roffler and Thomas Wicker","DNA (Class II) transposons are ubiquitous in plant genomes. However, unlike for (Class I) retrotransposons, only little is known about their proliferation mechanisms, activity, and impact on genomes. Asian and African rice (Oryza sativa and O. glaberrima) diverged approximately 600,000 years ago. Their fully sequenced genomes therefore provide an excellent opportunity to study polymorphisms introduced from recent transposon activity.,We manually analyzed 1,821 transposon related polymorphisms among which we identified 487 loci which clearly resulted from DNA transposon insertions and excisions. In total, we estimate about 4,000 (3.5% of all DNA transposons) to be polymorphic between the two species, indicating a high level of transposable element (TE) activity. The vast majority of the recently active elements are non-autonomous. Nevertheless, we identified multiple potentially functional autonomous elements. Furthermore, we quantified the impacts of insertions and excisions on the adjacent sequences. Transposon insertions were found to be generally precise, creating simple target site duplications. In contrast, excisions almost always go along with the deletion of flanking sequences and/or the insertion of foreign ‘filler’ segments. Some of the excision-triggered deletions ranged from hundreds to thousands of bp flanking the excision site. Furthermore, we found in some superfamilies unexpectedly low numbers of excisions. This suggests that some excisions might cause such large-scale rearrangements so that they cannot be detected anymore.,We conclude that the activity of DNA transposons (particularly the excision process) is a major evolutionary force driving the generation of genetic diversity.","28 April 2015","DNA transposon activity,Rice,Proliferation mechanism","wicker@botinst.uzh.ch","Thomas Wicker."

Despite long-standing speculation, there is limited understanding about the actual pathway by which group II introns evolved into eukaryotic introns. In this review, we focus on the evolution of group II introns themselves. We describe the different forms of group II introns known to exist in nature and then address how these forms may have evolved to give rise to spliceosomal introns and other genetic elements. Finally, we summarize the structural and biochemical parallels between group II introns and the spliceosome, including recent data that strongly support their hypothesized evolutionary relationship.","01 April 2015","Ribozyme,Retroelement,Spliceosome,Molecular evolution,Mobile DNA","zimmerly@ucalgary.ca","Steven Zimmerly."

At the same time, the preferential loss of repetitive elements in polyploids may be central to diploidization. The paucity of studies of transposable element (TE) dynamics in closely related diploid and polyploid species, however, prevents generalizations about these patterns. Here, we use low-coverage Illumina sequencing data for a clade of three tetraploid Orobanche species and a diploid relative to quantify the abundance and relative frequencies of different types of TEs. We confirmed tetraploidy in the sequenced individuals using standard cytogenetic methods and inferred the time of origin of the tetraploid clade with a rate-calibrated molecular clock.,The sequenced individuals of Orobanche austrohispanica, Orobanche densiflora, and Orobanche gracilis have 2n = 76 chromosomes, are tetraploid, and shared a most recent common ancestor some 6.7 Ma ago. Comparison of TE classifications from the Illumina data with classification from 454 data for one of the species revealed strong effects of sequencing technology on the detection of certain types of repetitive DNA. The three tetraploids show repeat enrichment especially of Gypsy TE families compared to eight previously analyzed Orobanchaceae. However, the diploid Orobanche rapum-genistae genome also has a very high proportion (30%) of Gypsy elements.,We had earlier suggested that tetraploidization might have contributed to an amplification of Gypsy elements, particularly of the Tekay clade, and that O. gracilis underwent genome downsizing following polyploidization. The new data reveal that Gypsy amplification in Orobanchaceae does not consistently relate to tetraploidy and that more species sampling is required to generalize about Tekay accumulation patterns.","25 March 2015","Transposable elements,Ploidy,Chromosomes,Gypsy,Copia,

Various HERV-K(HML-2) loci encode retrovirus-like proteins, and expression of such proteins is upregulated in certain tumor types. HERV-K(HML-2)-encoded Rec and Np9 proteins interact with functionally important cellular proteins and may contribute to tumor development. Though, the biological role of HERV-K(HML-2) transcription and encoded proteins in health and disease is less understood. We therefore investigated transcription specifically of HERV-K(HML-2) rec and np9 mRNAs in a panel of normal human tissues.,We obtained evidence for rec and np9 mRNA being present in all examined 16 normal tissue types. A total of 18 different HERV-K(HML-2) loci were identified as generating rec or np9 mRNA, among them loci not present in the human reference genome and several of the loci harboring open reading frames for Rec or Np9 proteins. Our analysis identified additional alternative splicing events of HERV-K(HML-2) transcripts, some of them encoding variant Rec/Np9 proteins. We also identified a second HERV-K(HML-2) locus formed by L1-mediated retrotransposition that is likewise transcribed in various human tissues.,HERV-K(HML-2) rec and np9 transcripts from different HERV-K(HML-2) loci appear to be present in various normal human tissues. It is conceivable that Rec and Np9 proteins and variants of those proteins are part of the proteome of normal human tissues and thus various cell types. Transcription of HERV-K(HML-2) may thus also have functional relevance in normal human cell physiology.","05 March 2015","Human endogenous retrovirus,Provirus,Transcription,Splicing,HERV-K Rec protein,HERV-K Np9 protein,Retrotransposition,L1 element","jens.mayer@uks.eu","Jens Mayer."

However, most of the HT of DNA transposons previously described occurred between closely related species or insects.,In this study, we carried out a detailed analysis of four DNA transposons, which were found in the first sequenced twisted-wing parasite, Mengenilla moldrzyki. Through the homology-based strategy, these transposons were also identified in other insects, freshwater planarian, hydrozoans, and bats. The phylogenetic distribution of these transposons was discontinuous, and they showed extremely high sequence identities (>87%) over their entire length in spite of their hosts diverging more than 300 million years ago (Mya). Additionally, phylogenies and comparisons of transposons versus orthologous gene identities demonstrated that these transposons have transferred into their hosts by independent HTs.,Here, we provided the first documented example of HT of CACTA transposons, which have been so far extensively studied in plants. Our results demonstrated that bats had continuously acquired new DNA elements via HT. This implies that predation on a large quantity of insects might increase bat exposure to HT. In addition, parasite-host interaction might facilitate exchanging of their genetic materials.","17 January 2015","Horizontal transfer,

Large advances in high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technology have allowed for an increased understanding of the role of L1 in human cancer; however, researchers are still limited by the ability to validate potentially rare L1 insertion events detected by HTS that may occur in only a small fraction of tumor cells. Additionally, HTS detection of rare events varies greatly as a function of read depth, and new tools for de novo element discovery are needed to fill in gaps created by HTS.,We have employed droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to detect rare L1 loci in mosaic human genomes.

Ongoing L1 retrotransposition in the germ line and somatic tissues has contributed to structural genomic variations and disease-causing mutations in the human genome. L1 mobilization relies on the function of two, self-encoded proteins, ORF1 and ORF2. The ORF2 protein contains two characterized domains: endonuclease and reverse transcriptase.,Using a bacterially purified endonuclease domain of the human L1 ORF2 protein, we have generated a monoclonal antibody specific to the human ORF2 protein. We determined that the epitope recognized by this monoclonal antibody includes amino acid 205, which is required for the function of the L1 ORF2 protein endonuclease. Using an in vitro L1 cleavage assay, we demonstrate that the monoclonal anti-ORF2 protein antibody partially inhibits L1 endonuclease activity without having any effect on the in vitro activity of the human AP endonuclease.,Overall, our data demonstrate that this anti-ORF2 protein monoclonal antibody is a useful tool for human L1-related studies and that it provides a rationale for the development of antibody-based inhibitors of L1-induced damage.","10 December 2014","Endonuclease,In vitro assay,L1,L1 antibody,LINE-1,ORF2,Retrotransposition","vperepe@tulane.edu","Victoria P Belancio."

Their mobilization may affect genomic expression and be a threat to genetic stability. This is why they have to be tightly regulated by a dedicated system. In the reproductive tissues of a large range of organisms, they are repressed by a subclass of small interfering RNAs called piRNAs (PIWI interacting RNAs). In Drosophila melanogaster, piRNAs are produced both in the ovarian germline cells and in their surrounding somatic cells. Accumulating evidence suggests that germinal and somatic piRNA pathways are far more different than previously thought. Here we review the current knowledge on piRNA production in both these cell types, and explore their similarities and differences.","04 December 2014","piRNA pathway,Transposable elements,Germline protection,RNA silencing","chantal.vaury@udamail.fr","Chantal Vaury."

It was previously shown that Hfq down-regulates Tn10 transposition by inhibiting IS10 transposase expression at the post-transcriptional level. This provided the first example of Hfq playing a role in DNA transposition and led us to ask if a related transposon, Tn5, is similarly regulated.,We show that Hfq strongly suppresses Tn5 transposition in Escherichia coli by inhibiting IS50 transposase expression. However, in contrast to the situation for Tn10, Hfq primarily inhibits IS50 transposase transcription. As Hfq does not typically function directly in transcription, we searched for a transcription factor that also down-regulated IS50 transposase transcription and is itself under Hfq control. We show that Crp (cyclic AMP receptor protein) fits these criteria as: (1) disruption of the crp gene led to an increase in IS50 transposase expression and the magnitude of this increase was comparable to that observed for an hfq disruption; and (2) Crp expression decreased in hfq−. We also demonstrate that IS50 transposase expression and Tn5 transposition are induced by over-expression of the sRNA SgrS and link this response to glucose limitation.,Tn5 transposition is negatively regulated by Hfq primarily through inhibition of IS50 transposase transcription. Preliminary results support the possibility that this regulation is mediated through Crp. We also provide evidence that glucose limitation activates IS50 transposase transcription and transposition.","30 November 2014","Tn5/IS50,Hfq,Crp,SgrS,DNA transposition","haniford@uwo.ca","David B Haniford."

Twin-ribozyme introns have so far been confined to nucleolar DNA in Naegleria amoeboflagellates and the myxomycete Didymium iridis.,We characterize structural organization, catalytic properties and molecular evolution of a new twin-ribozyme intron in Allovahlkampfia (Heterolobosea). The intron contains two ribozyme domains with different functions in ribosomal RNA splicing and homing endonuclease mRNA maturation. We found Allovahlkampfia GIR2 to be a typical group IC1 splicing ribozyme responsible for addition of the exogenous guanosine cofactor (exoG), exon ligation and circularization of intron RNA. The Allovahlkampfia LC ribozyme, by contrast, represents an efficient self-cleaving ribozyme that generates a small 2′,5′ lariat cap at the 5′ end of the homing endonuclease mRNA, and thus contributes to intron mobility.,The discovery of a twin-ribozyme intron in a member of Heterolobosea expands the distribution pattern of LC ribozymes.

Despite their low activity, several thousand copies can be identified in many genomes. CACTA elements transpose using a ‘cut-and-paste’ mechanism, which is facilitated by a DDE transposase. DDE transposases from CACTA elements contain, despite their conserved function, different exon numbers among various CACTA families. While earlier studies analyzed the ancestral history of the DDE transposases, no studies have examined exon loss and gain with a view of mechanisms that could drive the changes.,We analyzed 64 transposases from different CACTA families among monocotyledonous and eudicotyledonous host species. The annotation of the exon/intron boundaries showed a range from one to six exons. A robust multiple sequence alignment of the 64 transposases based on their protein sequences was created and used for phylogenetic analysis, which revealed eight different clades. We observed that the exon numbers in CACTA transposases are not specific for a host genome. We found that ancient CACTA lineages diverged before the divergence of monocotyledons and eudicotyledons. Most exon/intron boundaries were found in three distinct regions among all the transposases, grouping 63 conserved intron/exon boundaries.,We propose a model for the ancestral CACTA transposase gene, which consists of four exons, that predates the divergence of the monocotyledons and eudicotyledons. Based on this model, we propose pathways of intron loss or gain to explain the observed variation in exon numbers. While intron loss appears to have prevailed, a putative case of intron gain was nevertheless observed.","01 September 2014","Transposases,Intron loss,Molecular evolution,DNA transposons,Plants","jan.buchmann@sydney.edu.au","Jan P Buchmann."

Most Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are derived from genomic piRNA clusters. There has been remarkable progress in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying piRNA biogenesis.

This transposon’s family has been used as paradigm to investigate the complex dynamics underlying the persistence and structural evolution of transposable elements (TEs) within a genome. Three structural Bari variants have been identified so far and can be distinguished based on the organization of their terminal inverted repeats. Bari3 is the last discovered member of this family identified in Drosophila mojavensis, a recently emerged species of the Repleta group of the genus Drosophila.,We studied the insertion pattern of Bari3 in different D. mojavensis populations and found evidence of recent transposition activity. Analysis of the transposase domains unveiled the presence of a functional nuclear localization signal, as well as a functional binding domain. Using luciferase-based assays, we investigated the promoter activity of Bari3 as well as the interaction of its transposase with its left terminus. The results suggest that Bari3 is transposition-competent. Finally we demonstrated transposase transcript processing when the transposase gene is overexpressed in vivo and in vitro.,Bari3 displays very similar structural and functional features with its close relative, Bari1. Our results strongly suggest that Bari3 is an independent element that has generated genomic diversity in D. mojavensis. It can autonomously transcribe its transposase gene, which in turn can localize in the nucleus and bind the terminal inverted repeats of the transposon. Nevertheless, the identification of an unpredicted spliced form of the Bari3 transposase transcript allows us to hypothesize a control mechanism of its mobility based on mRNA processing. These results will aid the studies on the Bari family of transposons, which is intriguing for its widespread diffusion in Drosophilids coupled with a structural diversity generated during the evolution of Bari-like elements in their host genomes.","08 July 2014","Transposon,Transposase,Tc1-like elements,

In most LINE superfamilies there are two open reading frames (ORFs), and both are required for transposition. The ORF2 is well characterized, while the structure and function of the ORF1 is less well understood. ORF1s have been classified into five types based on structural organization and the domains identified. Here we perform a large scale analysis of ORF1 domains of 448 elements from the Jockey superfamily using multiple alignments and Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-HMM comparisons.,Three major lineages, Chicken repeat 1 (CR1), LINE2 (L2) and Jockey, were identified. All Jockey lineage elements have the same type of ORF1. In contrast, in the L2 and CR1 lineage elements, all five ORF1 types are found, with no one type of ORF1 predominating. A plant homeodomain (PHD) is much more prevalent than previously suspected. ORF1 type variations involving the PHD domain were found in many subgroups of the L2 and CR1 lineages. A Jockey lineage-like ORF1 with a PHD domain was found in both lineages. A phylogenetic analysis of this ORF1 suggests that it has been horizontally transferred. Likewise, an esterase containing ORF1 type was only found in two exclusively vertebrate L2 and CR1 groups, indicating that it may have been acquired in a vertebrate common ancestor and then transferred between the lineages.,The ORF1 of the CR1 and L2 lineages is very structurally diverse. The presence of a PHD domain in many ORF1s of the L2 and CR1 lineages is suggestive of domain shuffling. There is also evidence of possible horizontal transfer of entire ORF1s between lineages. In conclusion, while the structure of the ORF2 appears to be highly constrained and its evolution tree-like, the structure of the ORF1 within the CR1 and L2 lineages is much more variable and its evolution reticulate.","01 July 2014","Long interspersed nucleotide elements,Non-long terminal retrotransposon,Open reading frame 1,Plant homeodomain,RNA recognition motif","cushlametcalfe@gmail.com,Didier.Casane@legs.cnrs-gif.fr","Cushla J Metcalfe or Didier Casane."

In addition to the presence of an endonuclease domain fused to the Rep/Helicase protein, Helentrons have distinct structural features. Evidence is presented that illustrates that Helentrons are widely distributed in invertebrate, fish, and fungal genomes. We describe an intermediate family from the Phytophthora infestans genome that phylogenetically groups with Helentrons but that displays Helitron structure. In addition, evidence is presented that Helentrons can capture gene fragments in a pattern reminiscent of canonical Helitrons.,We illustrate the relationship of DINE-1 and related TE families to autonomous partners, the Helentrons.

Despite rapidly accumulating evidence for the role of TE-driven insertional mutagenesis and structural variation in genome evolution, few clear examples of individual TEs impacting biology via perturbed gene regulation are available. A recent report describes the discovery of an alternative promoter for the murine erythroid transcription factor Pu.1. This promoter is located in an ORR1A0 long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon intronic to Pu.1 and is regulated by the Krüppel-like factors KLF1 and KLF3. Expression of the resultant chimeric transcript, called Pu.2, spontaneously induces erythroid differentiation in vitro. These experiments illustrate how transcription factor binding sites spread by retrotransposition have the potential to impact networks encoding key biological processes in the host genome.","09 May 2014","LTR retrotransposon,Transposable element,

The deep conservation of MIRs initially suggested the possibility that they had been exapted to play functional roles for their host genomes. MIRs also happen to be the only TEs whose presence in-and-around human genes is positively correlated to tissue-specific gene expression. Similar associations of enhancer prevalence within genes and tissue-specific expression, along with MIRs’ previous implication as providing regulatory sequences, suggested a possible link between MIRs and enhancers.,To test the possibility that MIRs contribute functional enhancers to the human genome, we evaluated the relationship between MIRs and human tissue-specific enhancers in terms of genomic location, chromatin environment, regulatory function, and mechanistic attributes. This analysis revealed MIRs to be highly concentrated in enhancers of the K562 and HeLa human cell-types. Significantly more enhancers were found to be linked to MIRs than would be expected by chance, and putative MIR-derived enhancers are characterized by a chromatin environment highly similar to that of canonical enhancers. MIR-derived enhancers show strong associations with gene expression levels, tissue-specific gene expression and tissue-specific cellular functions, including a number of biological processes related to erythropoiesis. MIR-derived enhancers were found to be a rich source of transcription factor binding sites, underscoring one possible mechanistic route for the element sequences co-option as enhancers. There is also tentative evidence to suggest that MIR-enhancer function is related to the transcriptional activity of non-coding RNAs.,Taken together, these data reveal enhancers to be an important cis- regulatory platform from which MIRs can exercise a regulatory function in the human genome and help to resolve a long-standing conundrum as to the reason for MIRs’ deep evolutionary conservation.","05 May 2014","Histone Modification,Locus Control Region,Exon Array,Chromatin Environment,Histone Modification H3K4me1","king.jordan@biology.gatech.edu","I King Jordan."

RepeatMasker generates several output files, including the .out file, which provides annotations for all detected repeats in a query sequence. However, a remaining challenge consists of identifying the different copies of TEs that correspond to the identified hits. This step is essential for any evolutionary/comparative analysis of the different copies within a family. Different possibilities can lead to multiple hits corresponding to a unique copy of an element, such as the presence of large deletions/insertions or undetermined bases, and distinct consensus corresponding to a single full-length sequence (like for long terminal repeat (LTR)-retrotransposons). These possibilities must be taken into account to determine the exact number of TE copies.,We have developed a perl tool that parses the RepeatMasker .out file to better determine the number and positions of TE copies in the query sequence, in addition to computing quantitative information for the different families. To determine the accuracy of the program, we tested it on several RepeatMasker .out files corresponding to two organisms (Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens) for which the TE content has already been largely described and which present great differences in genome size, TE content, and TE families.,Our tool provides access to detailed information concerning the TE content in a genome at the family level from the .out file of RepeatMasker. This information includes the exact position and orientation of each copy, its proportion in the query sequence, and its quality compared to the reference element. In addition, our tool allows a user to directly retrieve the sequence of each copy and obtain the same detailed information at the family level when a local library with incomplete TE class/subclass information was used with RepeatMasker. We hope that this tool will be helpful for people working on the distribution and evolution of TEs within genomes.","01 May 2014","Transposable elements,RepeatMasker,Annotation","emmanuelle.lerat@univ-lyon1.fr","Emmanuelle Lerat."

Although the protist is presumed to reproduce asexually, 60% of its haploid genome contains transposable elements (TEs), known contributors to genome variability. The availability of a draft genome sequence and our collection of >200 global isolates of T. vaginalis facilitate the study and analysis of TE population dynamics and their contribution to genomic variability in this protist.,We present here a pilot study of a subset of class II Tc1/mariner TEs that belong to the T. vaginalis Tvmar1 family. We report the genetic structure of 19 Tvmar1 loci, their ability to encode a full-length transposase protein, and their insertion frequencies in 94 global isolates from seven regions of the world. While most of the Tvmar1 elements studied exhibited low insertion frequencies, two of the 19 loci (locus 1 and locus 9) show high insertion frequencies of 1.00 and 0.96, respectively. The genetic structuring of the global populations identified by principal component analysis (PCA) of the Tvmar1 loci is in general agreement with published data based on genotyping, showing that Tvmar1 polymorphisms are a robust indicator of T. vaginalis genetic history. Analysis of expression of 22 genes flanking 13 Tvmar1 loci indicated significantly altered expression of six of the genes next to five Tvmar1 insertions, suggesting that the insertions have functional implications for T. vaginalis gene expression.,Our study is the first in T. vaginalis to describe Tvmar1 population dynamics and its contribution to genetic variability of the parasite. We show that a majority of our studied Tvmar1 insertion loci exist at very low frequencies in the global population, and insertions are variable between geographical isolates. In addition, we observe that low frequency insertion is related to reduced or abolished expression of flanking genes. While low insertion frequencies might be expected, we identified two Tvmar1 insertion loci that are fixed across global populations. This observation indicates that Tvmar1 insertion may have differing impacts and fitness costs in the host genome and may play varying roles in the adaptive evolution of T. vaginalis.","24 April 2014","DNA transposable element,Mariner transposase,

Throughout evolution, the L1 has also been responsible for genomic insertion of thousands of processed pseudogenes and over one million nonautonomous retrotransposons called SINEs (mainly Alus and SVAs). The 6-kb human L1 has a 5′- untranslated region (UTR) that functions as an internal promoter, two open reading frames—ORF1, which encodes an RNA-binding protein, and ORF2, which expresses endonuclease and reverse transcriptase activities—and a 3′-UTR which ends in a poly(A) signal and tail. Most L1s are molecular fossils: truncated, rearranged or mutated. However, 80 to 100 remain potentially active in any human individual, and to date 101 de novo disease-causing germline retrotransposon insertions have been characterized. It is now clear that significant levels of retrotransposition occur not only in the human germline but also in some somatic cell types.

In a previous study, we introduced the concept of a repeat DNA module, a flexible motif present in at least two occurences in the sequences. This concept was embedded into ModuleOrganizer, a tool allowing the detection of repeat modules in a set of sequences. However, its implementation remains difficult for larger sequences.,Here we present Visual ModuleOrganizer, a Java graphical interface that enables a new and optimized version of the ModuleOrganizer tool. To implement this version, it was recoded in C++ with compressed suffix tree data structures. This leads to less memory usage (at least 120-fold decrease in average) and decreases by at least four the computation time during the module detection process in large sequences. Visual ModuleOrganizer interface allows users to easily choose ModuleOrganizer parameters and to graphically display the results. Moreover, Visual ModuleOrganizer dynamically handles graphical results through four main parameters: gene annotations, overlapping modules with known annotations, location of the module in a minimal number of sequences, and the minimal length of the modules. As a case study, the analysis of FoldBack4 sequences clearly demonstrated that our tools can be extended to comparative and evolutionary analyses of any repeat sequence elements in a set of genomic sequences. With the increasing number of sequences available in public databases, it is now possible to perform comparative analyses of repeated DNA modules in a graphic and friendly manner within a reasonable time period.,Visual ModuleOrganizer interface and the new version of the ModuleOrganizer tool are freely available at: http://lcb.cnrs-mrs.fr/spip.php?rubrique313.","28 March 2014","Compressed suffix tree,Maximal repeats,Repeat modules,Graphical interface","talla@imm.cnrs.fr","Emmanuel Talla."

Some group I introns are mobile genetic elements due to encoded homing endonuclease genes that function in DNA-based mobility pathways to promote spread to intronless alleles. Group I introns have a limited distribution among bacteria and the current assumption is that they are benign selfish elements, although some introns and homing endonucleases are a source of genetic novelty as they have been co-opted by host genomes to provide regulatory functions.

These proteins drive the mobility and persistence of their own reading frames. The genes that encode homing endonucleases are often embedded within self-splicing elements such as group I introns, group II introns and inteins. This combination of molecular functions is mutually advantageous: the endonuclease activity allows surrounding introns and inteins to act as invasive DNA elements, while the splicing activity allows the endonuclease gene to invade a coding sequence without disrupting its product. Crystallographic analyses of representatives from all known homing endonuclease families have illustrated both their mechanisms of action and their evolutionary relationships to a wide range of host proteins. Several homing endonucleases have been completely redesigned and used for a variety of genome engineering applications. Recent efforts to augment homing endonucleases with auxiliary DNA recognition elements and/or nucleic acid processing factors has further accelerated their use for applications that demand exceptionally high specificity and activity.","03 March 2014","Homing endonuclease,Meganuclease,Group I intron,Gene targeting","bstoddar@fhcrc.org","Barry L Stoddard."

"309","Whole genome sequencing in Drosophila virilis identifies Polyphemus, a recently activated Tc1-like transposon with a possible role in hybrid dysgenesis","Justin P Blumenstiel","Hybrid dysgenic syndromes in Drosophila have been critical for characterizing host mechanisms of transposable element (TE) regulation. This is because a common feature of hybrid dysgenesis is germline TE mobilization that occurs when paternally inherited TEs are not matched with a maternal pool of silencing RNAs that maintain transgenerational TE control. In the face of this imbalance TEs become activated in the germline and can cause F1 sterility. The syndrome of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila virilis was the first to show that the mobilization of one dominant TE, the Penelope retrotransposon, may lead to the mobilization of other unrelated elements. However, it is not known how many different elements contribute and no exhaustive search has been performed to identify additional ones. To identify additional TEs that may contribute to hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila virilis, I analyzed repeat content in genome sequences of inducer and non-inducer lines.,Here I describe Polyphemus, a novel Tc1-like DNA transposon, which is abundant in the inducer strain of D. virilis but highly degraded in the non-inducer strain. Polyphemus expression is also increased in the germline of progeny of the dysgenic cross relative to reciprocal progeny. Interestingly, like the Penelope element, it has experienced recent re-activation within the D. virilis lineage.,Here I present the results of a comprehensive search to identify additional factors that may cause hybrid dysgenesis in D. virilis. Polyphemus, a novel Tc1-like DNA transposon, has recently become re-activated in Drosophila virilis and likely contributes to the hybrid dysgenesis syndrome. It has been previously shown that the Penelope element has also been re-activated in the inducer strain. This suggests that TE co-reactivation within species may synergistically contribute to syndromes of hybrid dysgenesis.","20 February 2014","Hybrid dysgenesis,

However, our understanding of HTT dynamics is still poor in eukaryotes because the diversity of species for which whole genome sequences are available is biased and does not reflect the global eukaryote diversity.,In this study we characterized two Mariner transposable elements (TEs) in the genome of several terrestrial crustacean isopods, a group of animals particularly underrepresented in genome databases. The two elements have a patchy distribution in the arthropod tree and they are highly similar (>93% over the entire length of the element) to insect TEs (Diptera and Hymenoptera), some of which were previously described in Ceratitis rosa (Crmar2) and Drosophila biarmipes (Mariner-5_Dbi). In addition, phylogenetic analyses and comparisons of TE versus orthologous gene distances at various phylogenetic levels revealed that the taxonomic distribution of the two elements is incompatible with vertical inheritance.,We conclude that the two Mariner TEs each underwent at least three HTT events. Both elements were transferred once between isopod crustaceans and insects and at least once between isopod crustacean species. Crmar2 was also transferred between tephritid and drosophilid flies and Mariner-5 underwent HT between hymenopterans and dipterans. We demonstrate that these various HTTs took place recently (most likely within the last 3 million years), and propose iridoviruses and/or Wolbachia endosymbionts as potential vectors of these transfers.","29 January 2014","Horizontal transfer,Transposable elements,Isopod crustaceans,Hexapods","clement.gilbert@univ-poitiers.fr","Clément Gilbert."

They recognize DNA target sites largely by base pairing of sequences within the intron RNA and achieve high DNA target specificity by using the ribozyme active site to couple correct base pairing to RNA-catalyzed intron integration. Algorithms have been developed to program the DNA target site specificity of several mobile group II introns, allowing them to be made into ‘targetrons.’ Targetrons function for gene targeting in a wide variety of bacteria and typically integrate at efficiencies high enough to be screened easily by colony PCR, without the need for selectable markers. Targetrons have found wide application in microbiological research, enabling gene targeting and genetic engineering of bacteria that had been intractable to other methods. Recently, a thermostable targetron has been developed for use in bacterial thermophiles, and new methods have been developed for using targetrons to position recombinase recognition sites, enabling large-scale genome-editing operations, such as deletions, inversions, insertions, and ‘cut-and-pastes’ (that is, translocation of large DNA segments), in a wide range of bacteria at high efficiency. Using targetrons in eukaryotes presents challenges due to the difficulties of nuclear localization and sub-optimal magnesium concentrations, although supplementation with magnesium can increase integration efficiency, and directed evolution is being employed to overcome these barriers. Finally, spurred by new methods for expressing group II intron reverse transcriptases that yield large amounts of highly active protein, thermostable group II intron reverse transcriptases from bacterial thermophiles are being used as research tools for a variety of applications, including qRT-PCR and next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The high processivity and fidelity of group II intron reverse transcriptases along with their novel template-switching activity, which can directly link RNA-seq adaptor sequences to cDNAs during reverse transcription, open new approaches for RNA-seq and the identification and profiling of non-coding RNAs, with potentially wide applications in research and biotechnology.","13 January 2014","Genome engineering,Metabolic engineering,Next-generation RNA sequencing,Ribozyme,Synthetic biology,Systems biology,Targetron","lambowitz@austin.utexas.edu","Alan M Lambowitz."

Their capacity to move and/or multiply in the genome of their host may have profound impacts on phenotypes and dramatic consequences on genome structure. The population dynamics and distribution of TEs are influenced by their mode of transposition, the availability of niches in host genomes, and host population dynamics. Theories predict an increase in the number of TE insertions following hybridization or polyploidization. Evolution of TEs in hybrids and polyploids has mostly been studied in plants; few studies have examined the impacts of hybridization and/or polyploidization on TEs in animals. Hybrids and polyploids have arisen multiple times in the Daphnia pulex complex and are thought to reproduce by obligate parthenogenesis. Our study examines the effects of ploidy level on polymorphism and number of Pokey element insertions in diploid and polyploid hybrid isolates from the Daphnia pulex complex.,The polymorphism of Pokey insertion sites did not depend solely on either the ploidy level or the genetic background of their host; therefore, it may be the result of interactions between these parameters and other parameters such as Pokey activity, selection and/or drift. No significant effect of ploidy level was found on the number of Pokey insertions using TE display and qPCR. However, the load of Pokey insertion sites and the number of unique insertion sites were slightly (but not significantly) higher in polyploids than in diploids.,These results suggest a lack of increase in the number of Pokey insertions following polyploidization but higher availability of Pokey insertion sites in polyploids than in diploids. Compared to previous TE display and qPCR results, the load of Pokey insertions in hybrid diploids was higher than in non-hybrid sexual and asexual diploids, which suggests an increase in the density of Pokey insertions following hybridization.","02 January 2014","

Group II intron retroelements, which consist of a ribozyme and an intron-encoded protein (IEP), are usually identified in bacterial genomes through their IEP; however, the RNA component that defines the intron boundaries is often difficult to identify because of a lack of strong sequence conservation corresponding to the RNA structure. Compounding the problem of boundary definition is the fact that a majority of group II intron copies in bacteria are truncated.,Here we present a pipeline of 11 programs that collect and analyze group II intron sequences from GenBank. The pipeline begins with a BLAST search of GenBank using a set of representative group II IEPs as queries. Subsequent steps download the corresponding genomic sequences and flanks, filter out non-group II introns, assign introns to phylogenetic subclasses, filter out incomplete and/or non-functional introns, and assign IEP sequences and RNA boundaries to the full-length introns. In the final step, the redundancy in the data set is reduced by grouping introns into sets of ≥95% identity, with one example sequence chosen to be the representative.,These programs should be useful for comprehensive identification of group II introns in sequence databases as data continue to rapidly accumulate.","20 December 2013","Bacteria,Genomes,Retroelement,Reverse transcriptase,Ribozyme","zimmerly@ucalgary.ca","Steven Zimmerly."

Because of their abundance, the retrotransposons are the major players in genomic structure and function. While much attention has been focused on the biology of retrotransposons, little is known about the chromatin structure of these elements or the potential role of epigenetic marks on the regulation of retrotransposon expression.,Using sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, we analyzed the cohabitation of several post-translational histone modifications in the promoter regions of mouse L1 and LTR retrotransposons. We show here that the variant histone H2A.Z selectively present in L1 promoters. Notably, H2A.Z and trimethylated histone H3 (H3K9me3) co-localize in the same genomic location of the L1 promoter along with heterochromatin-binding protein HP1α. In contrast, Mm ERV and intracisternal A-particle (IAP) classes of LTR promoters are enriched with core histone H2A and heterochromatic trimethylated histone H4 (H4K20me3). These distinctive patterns of chromatin modifications are relatively consistent irrespective of cell type.,Chromatin structure regulates the expression of retrotransposons. LINE-1 elements are associated with H2A.Z and HP1α-containing constitutive heterochromatin, while the LTR elements are enriched with H2A and the H4K20me3-type of facultative heterochromatin.

The majority of these Alu elements were inserted into the primate genome 35 to 60 million years ago, but certain subfamilies of Alu elements are relatively very new and suspected to be still evolving. We attempted to trace the source/master copies of all human-specific members of the Alu Yb lineage using a computational approach by clustering similar Yb elements and constructing an evolutionary relation among the members of a cluster.,We discovered that one copy of Yb8 at 10p14 is the source of several active Yb8 copies, which retrotransposed to generate 712 copies or 54% of all human-specific Yb8 elements. We detected eight other Yb8 elements that had generated ten or more copies, potentially acting as 'stealth drivers’. One Yb8 element at 14q32.31 seemed to act as the source copy for all Yb9 elements tested, having producing 13 active Yb9 elements, and subsequently generated a total of 131 full-length copies. We identified and characterized three new subclasses of Yb elements: Yb8a1, Yb10 and Yb11. Their copy numbers in the reference genome are 75, 8 and 16. We analysed personal genome data from the 1000 Genome Project and detected an additional 6 Yb8a1, 3 Yb10 and 15 Yb11 copies outside the reference genome. Our analysis indicates that the Yb8a1 subfamily has a similar age to Yb9 (1.93 million years and 2.15 million years, respectively), while Yb10 and Yb11 evolved only 1.4 and 0.71 million years ago, suggesting a linear evolutionary path from Yb8a1 to Yb10 and then to Yb11. Our preliminary data indicate that members in Yb10 and Yb11 are mostly polymorphic, indicating their young age.,Our findings suggest that the Yb lineage is still evolving with new subfamilies being formed.

The dimers formed by these catalytic domains are very different from those seen for other serine recombinases and include interactions that usually only occur upon formation of a synaptic tetramer.,Based on these structures, we propose a model for how IS607-family transposases could form a synaptic tetramer. The model suggests that, unlike other serine recombinases, these enzymes carry out sequence-specific DNA binding and catalysis in trans: the DNA binding and catalytic domains of each subunit are proposed to interact with different DNA duplexes. The model also suggests an explanation for the minimal target DNA specificity.","06 November 2013","IS607,Serine recombinase,Site-specific recombinase,Structure,Transposase,Transposition mechanisms","price@uchicago.edu","Phoebe A Rice."

Three domesticated piggyBac elements have been described. In the ciliates Paramecium tetraurelia and Tetrahymena thermophila, homologs known as piggyMacs excise internal eliminated sequences from germline micronuclear DNA during regeneration of the new somatic macronucleus. In primates, a PGBD3 element inserted into the Cockayne syndrome group B (CSB) gene over 43 Mya serves as an alternative 3′ terminal exon, enabling the CSB gene to generate both full length CSB and a conserved CSB-PGBD3 fusion protein that joins an N-terminal CSB domain to the C-terminal transposase domain.,We describe a fourth domesticated piggyBac element called PGBD5. We show that i) PGBD5 was first domesticated in the common ancestor of the cephalochordate Branchiostoma floridae (aka lancelet or amphioxus) and vertebrates, and is conserved in all vertebrates including lamprey but cannot be found in more basal urochordates, hemichordates, or echinoderms; ii) the lancelet, lamprey, and human PGBD5 genes are syntenic and orthologous; iii) no potentially mobile ancestral PGBD5 elements can be identified in other more deeply rooted organisms; iv) although derived from an IS4-related transposase of the RNase H clan, PGBD5 protein is unlikely to retain enzymatic activity because the catalytic DDD(D) motif is not conserved; v) PGBD5 is preferentially expressed in certain granule cell lineages of the brain and in the central nervous system based on available mouse and human in situ hybridization data, and the tissue-specificity of documented mammalian EST and mRNA clones; vi) the human PGBD5 promoter and gene region is rich in bound regulatory factors including the neuron-restrictive silencer factors NRSF/REST and CoREST, as well as SIN3, KAP1, STAT3, and CTCF; and vii) despite preferential localization within the nucleus, PGBD5 protein is unlikely to bind DNA or chromatin as neither DNase I digestion nor high salt extraction release PGBD5 from fractionated mouse brain nuclei.,We speculate that the neural-specific PGBD5 transposase was domesticated >500 My after cephalochordates and vertebrates split from urochordates, and that PGBD5 may have played a role in the evolution of a primitive deuterostome neural network into a centralized nervous system.","01 November 2013","

Some of the most well recognized lesions are chromosomal translocations, and many of these are known to play pivotal roles in pathogenesis. In lymphoid malignancies, some translocations result from erroneous V(D)J-type events. However, other translocation junctions appear randomly positioned and their underlying mechanisms are not understood.,We tested the hypothesis that genomic repeats, including both simple tandem and interspersed repeats, are involved in chromosomal translocations arising in hematopoietic malignancies. Using a database of translocation junctions and RepeatMasker annotations of the reference genome assembly, we measured the proximity of translocation sites to their nearest repeat. We examined 1,174 translocation breakpoints from 10 classifications of hematolymphoid neoplasms. We measured significance using Student’s t-test, and we determined a false discovery rate using a random permutation statistics technique.,Most translocations showed no propensity to involve genomic repeats. However, translocation junctions at the transcription factor 3 (TCF3)/E2A immunoglobulin enhancer binding factors E12/E47 (E2A) locus clustered within, or in proximity to, transposable element sequences. Nearly half of reported TCF3 translocations involve a MER20 DNA transposon.

In order to understand the contribution of transposable elements (TEs) to Heliconius melpomene, we queried the H. melpomene draft sequence to identify repetitive sequences.,We determined that TEs comprise ~25% of the genome. The predominant class of TEs (~12% of the genome) was the non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons, including a novel SINE family. However, this was only slightly higher than content derived from DNA transposons, which are diverse, with several families having mobilized in the recent past. Compared to the only other well-studied lepidopteran genome, Bombyx mori, H. melpomene exhibits a higher DNA transposon content and a distinct repertoire of retrotransposons. We also found that H. melpomene exhibits a high rate of TE turnover with few older elements accumulating in the genome.,Our analysis represents the first complete, de novo characterization of TE content in a butterfly genome and suggests that, while TEs are able to invade and multiply, TEs have an overall deleterious effect and/or that maintaining a small genome is advantageous. Our results also hint that analysis of additional lepidopteran genomes will reveal substantial TE diversity within the group.","02 October 2013","

The only known rDNA-specific DNA transposon, Pokey (superfamily: piggyBac) is found in the freshwater microcrustacean, Daphnia pulex. Here, we present a genome-wide analysis of Pokey based on the recently completed whole genome sequencing project for D. pulex.,Phylogenetic analysis of Pokey elements recovered from the genome sequence revealed the presence of four lineages corresponding to two divergent autonomous families and two related lineages of non-autonomous miniature inverted repeat transposable elements (MITEs). The MITEs are also found at the same 28S rRNA gene insertion site as the Pokey elements, and appear to have arisen as deletion derivatives of autonomous elements. Several copies of the full-length Pokey elements may be capable of producing an active transposase. Surprisingly, both families of Pokey possess a series of 200 bp repeats upstream of the transposase that is derived from the rDNA intergenic spacer (IGS). The IGS sequences within the Pokey elements appear to be evolving in concert with the rDNA units. Finally, analysis of the insertion sites of Pokey elements outside of rDNA showed a target preference for sites similar to the specific sequence that is targeted within rDNA.,Based on the target site preference of Pokey elements and the concerted evolution of a segment of the element with the rDNA unit, we propose an evolutionary path by which the ancestors of Pokey elements have invaded the rDNA niche. We discuss how specificity for the rDNA unit may have evolved and how this specificity has played a role in the long-term survival of these elements in the subgenus Daphnia.","23 September 2013","Transposons,

In our previous studies, we identified endonuclease-deficient PLEs that are associated with telomeres in bdelloid rotifers, small freshwater invertebrates best known for their long-term asexuality and high foreign DNA content. Completion of the high-quality draft genome sequence of the bdelloid rotifer Adineta vaga provides us with the opportunity to examine its genomic transposable element (TE) content, as well as TE impact on genome function and evolution.,We performed an exhaustive search of the A. vaga genome assembly, aimed at identification of canonical PLEs combining both the reverse transcriptase (RT) and the GIY-YIG endonuclease (EN) domains. We find that the RT/EN-containing Penelope families co-exist in the A. vaga genome with the EN-deficient RT-containing Athena retroelements. Canonical PLEs are present at very low copy numbers, often as a single-copy, and there is no evidence that they might preferentially co-mobilize EN-deficient PLEs. We also find that Penelope elements can participate in expansion of A. vaga multigene families via trans-action of their enzymatic machinery, as evidenced by identification of intron-containing host genes framed by the Penelope terminal repeats and characteristic target-site duplications generated upon insertion. In addition, we find that Penelope open reading frames (ORFs) in several families have incorporated long stretches of coding sequence several hundred amino acids (aa) in length that are highly enriched in asparagine residues, a phenomenon not observed in other retrotransposons.,Our results show that, despite their low abundance and low transcriptional activity in the A. vaga genome, endonuclease-containing Penelope elements can participate in expansion of host multigene families. We conclude that the terminal repeats represent the cis-acting sequences required for mobilization of the intervening region in trans by the Penelope-encoded enzymatic activities. We also hypothesize that the unusual capture of long N-rich segments by the Penelope ORF occurs as a consequence of peculiarities of its replication mechanism. These findings emphasize the unconventional nature of Penelope retrotransposons, which, in contrast to all other retrotransposon types, are capable of dispersing intron-containing genes, thereby questioning the validity of traditional estimates of gene retrocopies in PLE-containing eukaryotic genomes.","27 August 2013","Retrotransposon,Reverse transcriptase,GIY-YIG endonuclease","iarkhipova@mbl.edu","Irina R Arkhipova."

The sequences of the retrotransposon array build up the telomere chromatin in this organism. We have recently reported the role of the chromosomal protein Putzig/Z4 in maintaining a proper chromatin structure at the telomere domain of Drosophila. Because the Putzig protein has been found in different cellular complexes related with cell proliferation, development, and immunity, we decided to investigate whether the previously described Putzig partners, DREF/TRF2 and KEN, could also be involved in the telomere function in this organism.,We have found that mutant alleles for Dref/Trf2 and Ken show alterations in HeT-A and TART expression, suggesting a possible role of these protein complexes in the regulation of the telomere retrotransposons. In agreement, both HeT-A and TART contain the specific DNA binding sequences for the DREF and the KEN protein proteins.,We have identified three new negative regulators involved in the control of the expression of the telomeric retrotransposons, Dref, Trf2, and Ken. Our results offer some clues on which other chromatin-related proteins might be involved in telomere regulation and retrotransposon control.","03 July 2013","Mutant Allele,Telomere Function,Telomere Chromatin,Telomere Associate Sequence,Drosophila Telomere","elena.casacuberta@ibe.upf-csic.es","Elena Casacuberta."

We, and others, have observed that different populations of HeLa cells from different laboratories support retrotransposition of LINE-1 and Alu to varying degrees. We therefore tested whether individual cell clones of HeLa and HCT116 cell lines supported different levels of LINE-1 and Alu retrotransposition, and whether these variations were stable upon re-cloning.,Standard retrotransposition tissue culture assays were used to measure a cell’s ability to support LINE-1 and Alu retrotransposition in clonal HeLa and HCT116 cell lines. We observed that both LINE-1 and Alu retrotransposition exhibited clonal variation in HeLa cells, with certain HeLa cell clones supporting high levels of LINE-1 and Alu retrotransposition and other cell clones being essentially retrotransposition-dead. This clonal variation was similarly observed in HCT116 cells, although possibly not to the same extent. These patterns of clonal variation are relatively consistent upon re-cloning.,Observations of the variability of LINE-1 and Alu retrotransposition in different populations of the same cell line are supported by our results that indicate in some cell types, individual cell clones can have dramatically differing capacity for retrotransposition. The mixed populations of cells commonly used in laboratories have often been passaged for many generations and accumulated significant genetic and epigenetic diversity. Our results suggest that the clonal variability observed by our cloning experiments may lead to a homogenization of retrotransposition capacity, with the resulting mixed population of cells being composed of individual variants having either increased or decreased retrotransposition potential compared to the starting population.","03 June 2013","LINE-1,Alu,Retrotransposition,Clone,Variation","pdeinin@tulane.edu","Prescott L Deininger."
"327","Regulation of DNA transposition by CpG methylation and chromatin structure in human cells","Tobias Jursch, Csaba Miskey, Zsuzsanna Izsvák and Zoltán Ivics","The activity of transposable elements can be regulated by different means. DNA CpG methylation is known to decrease or inhibit transpositional activity of diverse transposons. However, very surprisingly, it was previously shown that CpG methylation of the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon significantly enhanced transposition in mouse embryonic stem cells.,In order to investigate the unexpected response of SB transposition to CpG methylation, related transposons from the Tc1/mariner superfamily, that is, Tc1, Himar1, Hsmar1, Frog Prince (FP) and Minos were tested to see how transposition was affected by CpG methylation. A significant increase of >20-fold in transposition of SB, FP and Minos was seen, whereas Tc1, Himar1 and Hsmar1 showed no difference in transposition upon CpG-methylation. The terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) of the SB, FP and Minos elements share a common structure, in which each TIR contains two functionally important binding sites for the transposase (termed the IR/DR structure). The group of IR/DR elements showed increased excision after CpG methylation compared to untreated transposon donor plasmids. We found that de novo CpG methylation is not required for transposition. A mutated FP donor plasmid with depleted CpG sites in both TIRs was as efficient in transposition as the wild-type transposon, indicating that CpG sites inside the TIRs are not responsible for altered binding of factors potentially modulating transposition. By using an in vivo one-hybrid DNA-binding assay in cultured human cells we found that CpG methylation had no appreciable effect on the affinity of SB transposase to its binding sites. However, chromatin immunoprecipitation indicated that CpG-methylated transposon donor plasmids are associated with a condensed chromatin structure characterized by trimethylated histone H3K9. Finally, DNA compaction by protamine was found to enhance SB transposition.,We have shown that DNA CpG methylation upregulates transposition of IR/DR elements in the Tc1/mariner superfamily. CpG methylation provokes the formation of a tight chromatin structure at the transposon DNA, likely aiding the formation of a catalytically active complex by facilitating synapsis of sites bound by the transposase.","15 May 2013","Protamine,Sleep Beauty,Donor Plasmid,Transpositional Activity,Sleep Beauty Transposase","zoltan.ivics@pei.de","Zoltán Ivics."

This process, termed retrotransposition, requires the formation of an L1 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, which must enter the nucleus before retrotransposition can proceed. Thus, the nuclear import of L1 RNP presents an opportunity for cells to regulate L1 retrotransposition post-translationally. The effect of cell division on L1 retrotransposition has been investigated by two previous studies, which observed varied degrees of inhibition in retrotransposition when primary cell strains or cancer cell lines were experimentally arrested in different stages of the cell cycle. However, seemingly divergent conclusions were reached. The role of cell division on retrotransposition remains highly debated.,To monitor both L1 expression and retrotransposition quantitatively, we developed a stable dual-luciferase L1 reporter cell line, in which a bi-directional tetracycline-inducible promoter drives the expression of both a firefly luciferase-tagged L1 element and a Renilla luciferase, the latter indicative of the level of promoter induction. We observed an additional 10-fold reduction in retrotransposition in cell-cycle arrested cells even after retrotransposition had been normalized to Renilla luciferase or L1 ORF1 protein levels. In synchronized cells, cells undergoing two mitoses showed 2.6-fold higher retrotransposition than those undergoing one mitosis although L1 expression was induced for the same amount of time.,Our data provide additional support for an important role of cell division in retrotransposition and argue that restricting the accessibility of L1 RNP to nuclear DNA could be a post-translational regulatory mechanism for retrotransposition.","06 March 2013","Cell-cycle arrest,Cell-cycle synchronization,Cell division,Dual-luciferase assay,LINE-1,Non-LTR retrotransposon,Nuclear import,Tetracycline-inducible promoter,Transcription,Stable cell line","wenfengan@vetmed.wsu.edu","Wenfeng An."

They possess a unique genome structure that is characterized by a plethora of highly conserved sequence motifs in key domains of the non-coding genome, and often, by the presence of an envelope-like gene. Recently, their crucial role in the organization of the maize genome, where Sireviruses occupy approximately 21% of its nuclear content, was revealed, followed by an analysis of their distribution across the plant kingdom. It is now suggested that Sireviruses have been a major mediator of the evolution of many plant genomes. However, the name ‘Sirevirus’ has caused confusion in the scientific community in regards to their classification within the LTR retrotransposon order and their relationship with viruses - a situation that is not unique to Sireviruses, but also affects other LTR retrotransposon genera. Here, we clarify the phylogenetic position of Sireviruses as typical LTR retrotransposons of the Copia superfamily and explain that the confusion stems from the discrepancy in the categorization of LTR retrotransposons by the two main classification systems: the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) system and the unified classification system for eukaryotic transposable elements. While the name ‘Sirevirus’ has been given by ICTV, we show that the transposable element system, which is more suitable for eukaryotic genome studies, lacks an appropriate taxonomic level for describing them. We urge for this inconsistency to be addressed. Finally, we provide data suggesting that of the three ICTV-proposed genera of the Pseudoviridae (that is, Copia) family, only Sireviruses form a monophyletic group, while the phylogenetic distinction between Pseudoviruses and Hemiviruses is unclear. We conclude that because of their ongoing important contribution to the classification of transposable elements, these schemes need to be frequently revisited and revised - as shown by the example of the Sirevirus LTR retrotransposon genus.","04 March 2013","Sirevirus,Transposable elements,LTR retrotransposons,ICTV,Phylogenetic analysis,Pseudoviridae,Copia,Plant genomes,Maize","alexandros.bousios@gmail.com","Alexandros Bousios."

They are widely distributed within the plant kingdom, with representatives even in lower plants such as green and red algae. Their hallmark is the presence of a chromodomain at the C-terminus of the integrase. The chromodomain exhibits structural characteristics similar to proteins of the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family, which mediate the binding of each chromovirus type to specific histone variants. A specific integration via the chromodomain has been shown for only a few chromoviruses. However, a detailed study of different chromoviral clades populating a single plant genome has not yet been carried out.,We conducted a comprehensive survey of chromoviruses within the Beta vulgaris (sugar beet) genome, and found a highly diverse chromovirus population, with significant differences in element size, primarily caused by their flanking LTRs. In total, we identified and annotated full-length members of 16 families belonging to the four plant chromoviral clades: CRM, Tekay, Reina, and Galadriel. The families within each clade are structurally highly conserved; in particular, the position of the chromodomain coding region relative to the polypurine tract is clade-specific. Two distinct groups of chromodomains were identified. The group II chromodomain was present in three chromoviral clades, whereas families of the CRM clade contained a more divergent motif. Physical mapping using representatives of all four clades identified a clade-specific integration pattern. For some chromoviral families, we detected the presence of expressed sequence tags, indicating transcriptional activity.,We present a detailed study of chromoviruses, belonging to the four major clades, which populate a single plant genome. Our results illustrate the diversity and family structure of B. vulgaris chromoviruses, and emphasize the role of chromodomains in the targeted integration of these viruses.

Their capacity to move and/or multiply in the genome of their host may have profound impacts on phenotypes, and may have dramatic consequences on genome structure. Hybrid and polyploid clones have arisen multiple times in the Daphnia pulex complex and are thought to reproduce by obligate parthenogenesis. Our study examines the evolution of a DNA transposable element named Pokey in the D. pulex complex.,Portions of Pokey elements inserted in the 28S rRNA genes from various Daphnia hybrids (diploids and polyploids) were sequenced and compared to sequences from a previous study to understand the evolutionary history of the elements. Pokey sequences show a complex phylogenetic pattern. We found evidence of recombination events in numerous Pokey alleles from diploid and polyploid hybrids and also from non-hybrid diploids. The recombination rate in Pokey elements is comparable to recombination rates previously estimated for 28S rRNA genes in the congener, Daphnia obtusa. Some recombinant Pokey alleles were encountered in Daphnia isolates from multiple locations and habitats.,Phylogenetic and recombination analyses showed that recombination is a major force that shapes Pokey evolution. Based on Pokey phylogenies, reticulation has played and still plays an important role in shaping the diversity of the D. pulex complex. Horizontal transfer of Pokey seems to be rare and hybrids often possess Pokey elements derived from recombination among alleles encountered in the putative parental species. The insertion of Pokey in hotspots of recombination may have important impacts on the diversity and fitness of this transposable element.","06 February 2013","

"337","Striking structural dynamism and nucleotide sequence variation of the transposon Galileo in the genome of Drosophila mojavensis","Mar Marzo, Xabier Bello, Marta Puig, Xulio Maside and Alfredo Ruiz","Galileo is a transposable element responsible for the generation of three chromosomal inversions in natural populations of Drosophila buzzatii. Although the most characteristic feature of Galileo is the long internally-repetitive terminal inverted repeats (TIRs), which resemble the Drosophila Foldback element, its transposase-coding sequence has led to its classification as a member of the P-element superfamily (Class II, subclass 1, TIR order). Furthermore, Galileo has a wide distribution in the genus Drosophila, since it has been found in 6 of the 12 Drosophila sequenced genomes. Among these species, D. mojavensis, the one closest to D. buzzatii, presented the highest diversity in sequence and structure of Galileo elements.,In the present work, we carried out a thorough search and annotation of all the Galileo copies present in the D. mojavensis sequenced genome. In our set of 170 Galileo copies we have detected 5 Galileo subfamilies (C, D, E, F, and X) with different structures ranging from nearly complete, to only 2 TIR or solo TIR copies. Finally, we have explored the structural and length variation of the Galileo copies that point out the relatively frequent rearrangements within and between Galileo elements. Different mechanisms responsible for these rearrangements are discussed.,Although Galileo is a transposable element with an ancient history in the D. mojavensis genome, our data indicate a recent transpositional activity. Furthermore, the dynamism in sequence and structure, mainly affecting the TIRs, suggests an active exchange of sequences among the copies. This exchange could lead to new subfamilies of the transposon, which could be crucial for the long-term survival of the element in the genome.","04 February 2013","Transposable element,

They are difficult to analyse due to their variability.,The aim was to obtain a more comprehensive view of structure, diversity and phylogeny of LTRs than hitherto possible.,Hidden Markov models (HMM) were created for 11 clades of LTRs belonging to Retroviridae (class III retroviruses), animal Metaviridae (Gypsy/Ty3) elements and plant Pseudoviridae (Copia/Ty1) elements, complementing our work with Orthoretrovirus HMMs. The great variation in LTR length of plant Metaviridae and the few divergent animal Pseudoviridae prevented building HMMs from both of these groups.,Animal Metaviridae LTRs had the same conserved motifs as retroviral LTRs, confirming that the two groups are closely related. The conserved motifs were the short inverted repeats (SIRs), integrase recognition signals (5´TGTTRNR…YNYAACA 3´); the polyadenylation signal or AATAAA motif; a GT-rich stretch downstream of the polyadenylation signal; and a less conserved AT-rich stretch corresponding to the core promoter element, the TATA box. Plant Pseudoviridae LTRs differed slightly in having a conserved TATA-box, TATATA, but no conserved polyadenylation signal, plus a much shorter R region.,The sensitivity of the HMMs for detection in genomic sequences was around 50% for most models, at a relatively high specificity, suitable for genome screening.,The HMMs yielded consensus sequences, which were aligned by creating an HMM model (a ‘Superviterbi’ alignment). This yielded a phylogenetic tree that was compared with a Pol-based tree. Both LTR and Pol trees supported monophyly of retroviruses. In both, Pseudoviridae was ancestral to all other LTR retrotransposons. However, the LTR trees showed the chromovirus portion of Metaviridae clustering together with Pseudoviridae, dividing Metaviridae into two portions with distinct phylogeny.,The HMMs clearly demonstrated a unitary conserved structure of LTRs, supporting that they arose once during evolution. We attempted to follow the evolution of LTRs by tracing their functional foundations, that is, acquisition of RNAse H, a combined promoter/ polyadenylation site, integrase, hairpin priming and the primer binding site (PBS). Available information did not support a simple evolutionary chain of events.","01 February 2013","LTR,Long terminal repeat,Retrotransposon,Retrovirus,Phylogeny,Genome evolution","Jonas.Blomberg@medsci.uu.se","Jonas Blomberg."

L1 has significantly affected the size and structure of all mammalian genomes and understanding the nature of the interactions between L1 and its mammalian host remains a question of crucial importance in comparative genomics. For this reason, much attention has been dedicated to the evolution of L1. Among the most studied elements is the mouse L1 which has been the subject of a number of studies in the 1980s and 1990s. These seminal studies, performed in the pre-genomic era when only a limited number of L1 sequences were available, have significantly improved our understanding of L1 evolution. Yet, no comprehensive study on the evolution of L1 in mouse has been performed since the completion of this genome sequence.,Using the Genome Parsing Suite we performed the first evolutionary analysis of mouse L1 over the entire length of the element. This analysis indicates that the mouse L1 has recruited novel 5’UTR sequences more frequently than previously thought and that the simultaneous activity of non-homologous promoters seems to be one of the conditions for the co-existence of multiple L1 families or lineages. In addition the exchange of genetic information between L1 families is not limited to the 5’UTR as evidence of inter-family recombination was observed in ORF1, ORF2, and the 3’UTR. In contrast to the human L1, there was little evidence of rapid amino-acid replacement in the coiled-coil of ORF1, although this region is structurally unstable. We propose that the structural instability of the coiled-coil domain might be adaptive and that structural changes in this region are selectively equivalent to the rapid evolution at the amino-acid level reported in the human lineage.,The pattern of evolution of L1 in mouse shows some similarity with human suggesting that the nature of the interactions between L1 and its host might be similar in these two species. Yet, some notable differences, particularly in the evolution of ORF1, suggest that the molecular mechanisms involved in host-L1 interactions might be different in these two species.","03 January 2013","Retroposon,Retrotransposon,LINE-1,L1,

Members of this subfamily often function as phage integrases but also mediate transposition and regulate terminal differentiation processes in eubacteria. Although a few members of this subfamily have been studied in purified in vitro systems, key mechanistic aspects of reactions promoted by these recombinases remain to be determined, particularly with respect to the functions of the large C-terminal domain.,We have developed and characterized a robust in vitro recombination reaction by the Listeria phage A118 integrase, a member of the subfamily of serine recombinases containing a large C-terminal domain. The reaction occurs in a simple buffered salt solution and exhibits a modest stimulation by divalent cations or spermidine and DNA supercoiling. Recombination with purified A118 integrase is unidirectional, being efficient only between attP and attB DNA sites to either join separate DNA molecules (intermolecular recombination) or to generate deletions or inversions depending on the relative orientation of att sites in cis (intramolecular recombination). The minimal attP site is 50 bp but requires only 44 bp of base sequence information, whereas the minimal attB site is 42 bp and requires 38 bp of base sequence information. DNA exchange occurs between the central 2 bp of attP and attB. Identity between these two base pairs is required for recombination, and they solely determine the orientation of recombination sites. The integrase dimer binds efficiently to full att sites, including the attL and attR integration products, but poorly and differentially to each half-site. The large C-terminal domain can be separated from the N-terminal catalytic by partial proteolysis and mediates non-cooperative DNA binding to att sites.,The basic properties of the phage A118 integrase reaction and its substrate requirements have been elucidated. A118 integrase thus joins the handful of biochemically characterized serine integrases that are serving as models for mechanistic studies on this important class of recombinases. Information reported here will also be useful in exploiting this recombinase for genetic engineering.","03 January 2013","Serine recombinases,Phage integrases,In vitro recombination,Domain structure,Recombination (att) site determinants and specificity","rcjohnson@mednet.ucla.edu","Reid C Johnson."

Several databases report the sequence of small regulatory RNAs which play a prominent role in the control of transposable elements (TE). However, the huge amount of data reported in these databases remains mostly unexplored because the available tools are hard for biologists to use.,Here we report NucBase, a new program designed to make an exhaustive search for sequence matches and to align short sequence reads from large nucleic acid databases to genomes or input sequences. NucBase includes a graphical interface which allows biologists to align sequences with ease and immediately visualize matched sequences, their number and their genomic position. NucBase identifies nucleic motives with strict identity to input sequences, and it capably finds candidates with one or several mismatches. It offers the opportunity to identify “core sequences” comprised of a chosen number of consecutive matching nucleotides. This software can be run locally on any Windows, Linux or Mac OS computer with 32-bit architecture compatibility.,Since this software is easy to use and can detect reads that were undetected by other software, we believe that it will be useful for biologists involved in the field of TE silencing by small non-coding RNAs. We hope NucBase will be useful for a larger community of researchers, since it makes exploration of small nucleic sequences in any organism much easier.","01 January 2013","Alignment,Short reads","Chantal.VAURY@udamail.fr","Chantal Vaury."

However, the molecular bases of Ty1 targeting are still not understood.,The publications by Baller et al. and Mularoni et al. in the April issue of Genome Res. report the first high-throughput sequencing analysis of Ty1 de novo insertion events. Their observations converge to the same conclusion, that Ty1 targets a specific surface of the nucleosome at he H2A/H2B interface.,This discovery is important, and should help identifying factor(s) involved in Ty1 targeting. Recent data on transposable elements and retroviruses integration site choice obtained by large-scale analyses indicate that transcription and chromatin structure play an important role in this process.

Mu provided the first molecular evidence of insertion elements in E. coli, postulated by McClintock to control gene activity in maize in the pre-DNA era. An early Mu-based model successfully explained all the DNA rearrangements associated with transposition, providing a blueprint for navigating the deluge of accumulating reports on transposable element activity. Amplification of the Mu genome via transposition meant that its transposition frequencies were orders of magnitude greater than any rival, so it was only natural that the first in vitro system for transposition was established for Mu. These experiments unraveled the chemistry of the phosphoryl transfer reaction of transposition, and shed light on the nucleoprotein complexes within which they occur. They hastened a similar analysis of other transposons and ushered in the structural era where many transpososomes were crystallized. While it was a lucky break that the mechanism of HIV DNA integration turned out to be similar to that of Mu, it is no accident that current drugs for HIV integrase inhibitors owe their discovery to trailblazing experiments done with Mu. Shining the light on how movable elements restructure genomes, Mu has also given of itself generously to understanding the genome.","05 December 2012","Historical significance of Mu,Mu DNA transposition,Shapiro model,Phosphoryl transfer,Transpososome structure,HIV integrase inhibitors","rasika@uts.cc.utexas.edu","Rasika M Harshey."

Here we present the results of a survey into the ERV complement of Crocodylus porosus, the saltwater crocodile, representing 45 individuals from 17 sampling locations in the Northern Territory of Australia. These retroelements were compared with published ERVs from other species of Crocodylia (Crocodilians; alligators, caimans, gharials and crocodiles) as well as representatives from other vertebrates. This study represents one of the first in-depth studies of ERVs within a single reptilian species shedding light on the diversity of ERVs and proliferation mechanisms in crocodilians.,Analyses of the retroviral pro-pol gene region have corroborated the presence of two major clades of ERVs in C. porosus and revealed 18 potentially functional fragments out of the 227 recovered that encode intact pro-pol ORFs. Interestingly, we have identified some patterns of diversification among those ERVs as well as a novel sequence that suggests the presence of an additional retroviral genus in C. porosus. In addition, considerable diversity but low genetic divergence within one of the C. porosus ERV lineages was identified.,We propose that the ERV complement of C. porosus has come about through a combination of recent infections and replication of ancestral ERVs. Strong purifying selection acting on these clades suggests that this activity is recent or still occurring in the genome of this species. The discovery of potentially functional elements is an interesting development that warrants further investigation.","05 December 2012","Crocodylia,Endogenous retrovirus,

Hence they are well suited for computational identification. Current software allows for a comprehensive genome-wide de novo detection of such elements. The obvious next step is the classification of newly detected candidates resulting in (super-)families. Such a de novo classification approach based on sequence-based clustering of transposon features has been proposed before, resulting in a preliminary assignment of candidates to families as a basis for subsequent manual refinement. However, such a classification workflow is typically split across a heterogeneous set of glue scripts and generic software (for example, spreadsheets), making it tedious for a human expert to inspect, curate and export the putative families produced by the workflow.,We have developed LTRsift, an interactive graphical software tool for semi-automatic postprocessing of de novo predicted LTR retrotransposon annotations. Its user-friendly interface offers customizable filtering and classification functionality, displaying the putative candidate groups, their members and their internal structure in a hierarchical fashion. To ease manual work, it also supports graphical user interface-driven reassignment, splitting and further annotation of candidates. Export of grouped candidate sets in standard formats is possible. In two case studies, we demonstrate how LTRsift can be employed in the context of a genome-wide LTR retrotransposon survey effort.,LTRsift is a useful and convenient tool for semi-automated classification of newly detected LTR retrotransposons based on their internal features. Its efficient implementation allows for convenient and seamless filtering and classification in an integrated environment. Developed for life scientists, it is helpful in postprocessing and refining the output of software for predicting LTR retrotransposons up to the stage of preparing full-length reference sequence libraries.

TE sequences within the introns of human genes show an antisense orientation bias, which has been proposed to reflect selection against TE sequences in the sense orientation owing to their ability to terminate the transcription of host gene transcripts. While there is evidence in support of this model for some elements, the extent to which TE sequences actually terminate transcription of human gene across the genome remains an open question.,Using high-throughput sequencing data, we have characterized over 9,000 distinct TE-derived sequences that provide transcription termination sites for 5,747 human genes across eight different cell types. Rarefaction curve analysis suggests that there may be twice as many TE-derived termination sites (TE-TTS) genome-wide among all human cell types. The local chromatin environment for these TE-TTS is similar to that seen for 3′ UTR canonical TTS and distinct from the chromatin environment of other intragenic TE sequences. However, those TE-TTS located within the introns of human genes were found to be far more cell type-specific than the canonical TTS. TE-TTS were much more likely to be found in the sense orientation than other intragenic TE sequences of the same TE family and TE-TTS in the sense orientation terminate transcription more efficiently than those found in the antisense orientation. Alu sequences were found to provide a large number of relatively weak TTS, whereas LTR elements provided a smaller number of much stronger TTS.,TE sequences provide numerous termination sites to human genes, and TE-derived TTS are particularly cell type-specific. Thus, TE sequences provide a powerful mechanism for the diversification of transcriptional profiles between cell types and among evolutionary lineages, since most TE-TTS are evolutionarily young. The extent of transcription termination by TEs seen here, along with the preference for sense-oriented TE insertions to provide TTS, is consistent with the observed antisense orientation bias of human TEs.","30 September 2012","Polyadenylation,Transcription termination,Orientation bias,Gene regulation","king.jordan@biology.gatech.edu","I King Jordan."

MITEs were originally recognized as important components of plant genomes, where they can attain extremely high copy numbers, and are also found in several animal genomes, including mosquitoes, fish and humans. So far, few MITEs have been described in Drosophila.,Herein we describe the distribution and evolution of Mar, a MITE family of hAT transposons, in Drosophilidae species. In silico searches and PCR screening showed that Mar distribution is restricted to the willistoni subgroup of the Drosophila species, and a phylogenetic analysis of Mar indicates that this element may have originated prior to the diversification of these species. Most of the Mar copies in D. willistoni present conserved target site duplications and TIRs, indicating recent mobilization of these sequences. We also identified relic copies of potentially full-length Mar transposon in D. tropicalis and D. willistoni. The phylogenetic relationship among transposases from the putative full-length Mar and other hAT superfamily elements revealed that Mar is placed into the recently determined Buster group of hAT transposons.,On the basis of the obtained data, we can suggest that the origin of these Mar MITEs occurred before the subgroup willistoni speciation, which started about 5.7 Mya. The Mar relic transposase existence indicates that these MITEs originated by internal deletions and suggests that the full-length transposon was recently functional in D. willistoni, promoting Mar MITEs mobilization.","31 August 2012","MITEs,Buster,hAT,Transposase,

The limited coding capacity of retrotransposons necessitates an extensive reliance on host co-factors; however, it has been challenging to identify co-factors that are required for endogenous retrotransposon mobility because retrotransposition is such a rare event.,To circumvent the low frequency of Ty1 LTR-retrotransposon mobility in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we used iterative synthetic genetic array (SGA) analysis to isolate host mutations that reduce retrotransposition. Query strains that harbor a chromosomal Ty1his3AI reporter element and either the rtt101Δ or med1Δ mutation, both of which confer a hypertransposition phenotype, were mated to 4,847 haploid ORF deletion strains. Retrotransposition was measured in the double mutant progeny, and a set of 275 ORF deletions that suppress the hypertransposition phenotypes of both rtt101Δ and med1Δ were identified. The corresponding set of 275 retrotransposition host factors (RHFs) includes 45 previously identified Ty1 or Ty3 co-factors. More than half of the RHF genes have statistically robust human homologs (E < 1 x 10-10). The level of unintegrated Ty1 cDNA in 181 rhfΔ single mutants was altered <2-fold, suggesting that the corresponding co-factors stimulate retrotransposition at a step after cDNA synthesis. However, deletion of 43 RHF genes, including specific ribosomal protein and ribosome biogenesis genes and RNA degradation, modification and transport genes resulted in low Ty1 cDNA levels. The level of Ty1 Gag but not RNA was reduced in ribosome biogenesis mutants bud21Δ, hcr1Δ, loc1Δ, and puf6Δ.,Ty1 retrotransposition is dependent on multiple co-factors acting at different steps in the replication cycle. Human orthologs of these RHFs are potential, or in a few cases, presumptive HIV-1 co-factors in human cells. RHF genes whose absence results in decreased Ty1 cDNA include characterized RNA metabolism and modification genes, consistent with their having roles in early steps in retrotransposition such as expression, nuclear export, translation, localization, or packaging of Ty1 RNA. Our results suggest that Bud21, Hcr1, Loc1, and Puf6 promote efficient synthesis or stability of Ty1 Gag.","02 August 2012","Ty1,LTR-retrotransposon,Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Host factor,Ribosome,Biogenesis","curcio@wadsworth.org","M Joan Curcio."

The first step in identifying the active Alu sources is to determine the loci transcribed by RNA polymerase III (pol III). Previous genome-wide analyses from normal and transformed cell lines identified multiple Alu loci occupied by pol III factors, making them candidate source elements.,Analysis of the data from these genome-wide studies determined that the majority of pol III-bound Alus belonged to the older subfamilies Alu S and Alu J, which varied between cell lines from 62.5% to 98.7% of the identified loci. The pol III-bound Alus were further scored for estimated retrotransposition potential (ERP) based on the absence or presence of selected sequence features associated with Alu retrotransposition capability. Our analyses indicate that most of the pol III-bound Alu loci candidates identified lack the sequence characteristics important for retrotransposition.,These data suggest that Alu expression likely varies by cell type, growth conditions and transformation state. This variation could extend to where the same cell lines in different laboratories present different Alu expression patterns. The vast majority of Alu loci potentially transcribed by RNA pol III lack important sequence features for retrotransposition and the majority of potentially active Alu loci in the genome (scored high ERP) belong to young Alu subfamilies. Our observations suggest that in an in vivo scenario, the contribution of Alu activity on somatic genetic damage may significantly vary between individuals and tissues.","20 June 2012","Alu source elements,Alu expression,RT-PCR,ChIP-seq,Retrotransposition,SINE","aengel@tulane.edu","Astrid M Roy-Engel."
"354","R2 and R2/R1 hybrid non-autonomous retrotransposons derived by internal deletions of full-length elements","Danna G Eickbush and Thomas H Eickbush","R2 is a non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposable element that inserts site specifically into the 28S genes of the ribosomal (r)RNA gene loci. Encoded at the 5' end is a ribozyme that generates the precise 5' end by self-cleavage of a 28S gene cotranscript. Sequences at the 3' end are necessary for the R2 protein to bind RNA and initiate the target primed reverse transcription (TPRT) reaction. These minimal RNA requirements suggested that if recombination/DNA repair conjoined the 5' and 3' ends of R2, the result would be a non-autonomous element that could survive as long as autonomous R2 elements supplied the TPRT activity.,A PCR-based survey of 39 Drosophila species aided by genomic sequences from 12 of these species revealed two types of non-autonomous elements. We call these elements SIDEs (for ‘Short Internally Deleted Elements’). The first consisted of a 5' ribozyme and a 3' end of an R2 element as predicted. Variation at the 5' junctions of the R2 SIDE copies was typical for R2 insertions suggesting their propagation by TPRT. The second class of SIDE contained sequences from R1 elements, another non-LTR retrotransposon that inserts into rRNA gene loci. These insertions had an R2 ribozyme immediately upstream of R1 3' end sequences. These hybrid SIDEs were inserted at the R1 site with 14 bp target site duplications typical of R1 insertions suggesting they used the R1 machinery for retrotransposition. Finally, the survey revealed examples of U12 small nuclear (sn)RNA and tRNA sequences at the 5' end of R2 elements suggesting the R2 reverse transcriptase can template jump from the R2 transcript to a second RNA during TPRT.,The R2 SIDE and R2/R1 hybrid SIDEs are rare examples of non-autonomous retrotransposons in the Drosophila genome. Associated non-autonomous elements and in vivo template jumps are two additional characteristics R2 shares with other non-LTR retrotransposons such as mammalian L1s. Analysis of the hybrid SIDEs provides supporting evidence that R1 elements, like R2 elements, recognize their 3' untranslated region (UTR) sequences and, thus, belong to the stringent class of non-LTR elements.","23 May 2012","LINE,Non-autonomous elements,Retrotransposon,Ribozyme,SINE,Template jump","thomas.eickbush@rochester.edu","Thomas H Eickbush."

With relatively few young polymorphic insertions, the genomic landscape of the orangutan seemed like the ideal place to search for a driver, or source element, of Alu retrotransposition.,Here we report the identification of a nearly pristine insertion possessing all the known putative hallmarks of a retrotranspositionally competent Alu element. It is located in an intronic sequence of the DGKB gene on chromosome 7 and is highly conserved in Hominidae (the great apes), but absent from Hylobatidae (gibbon and siamang). We provide evidence for the evolution of a lineage-specific subfamily of this shared Alu insertion in orangutans and possibly the lineage leading to humans. In the orangutan genome, this insertion contains three orangutan-specific diagnostic mutations which are characteristic of the youngest polymorphic Alu subfamily, Alu Ye5b5_Pongo. In the Homininae lineage (human, chimpanzee and gorilla), this insertion has acquired three different mutations which are also found in a single human-specific Alu insertion.,This seemingly stealth-like amplification, ongoing at a very low rate over millions of years of evolution, suggests that this shared insertion may represent an ancient backseat driver of Alu element expansion.","30 April 2012","Additional Data File,Sumatran Orangutan,Bornean Orangutan,Orangutan Genome,Rhesus Macaque Genome","mbatzer@lsu.edu","Mark A Batzer."
"357","Identification of basepairs within Tn5 termini that are critical sfor H-NS binding to the transpososome and regulation of Tn5 transposition","Crystal R Whitfield, Brian H Shilton and David B Haniford","The H-NS protein is a global regulator of gene expression in bacteria and can also bind transposition complexes (transpososomes). In Tn5 transposition H-NS promotes transpososome assembly in vitro and disruption of the hns gene causes a modest decrease in Tn5 transposition (three- to five-fold). This is consistent with H-NS acting as a positive regulator of Tn5 transposition. Molecular determinants for H-NS binding to the Tn5 transpososome have not been determined, nor has the strength of the interaction been established. There is also uncertainty as to whether H-NS regulates Tn5 transposition in vivo through an interaction with the transposition machinery as disruption of the hns gene has pleiotropic effects on Escherichia coli, the organism used in this study.,In the current work we have further examined determinants for H-NS binding to the Tn5 transpososome through both mutational studies on Tn5 termini (or 'transposon ends') and protein-protein cross-linking analysis. We identify mutations in two different segments of the transposon ends that abrogate H-NS binding and characterize the affinity of H-NS for wild type transposon ends in the context of the transpososome. We also show that H-NS forms cross-links with the Tn5 transposase protein specifically in the transpososome, an observation consistent with the two proteins occupying overlapping binding sites in the transposon ends. Finally, we make use of the end mutations to test the idea that H-NS exerts its impact on Tn5 transposition in vivo by binding directly to the transpososome. Consistent with this possibility, we show that two different end mutations reduce the sensitivity of the Tn5 system to H-NS regulation.,H-NS typically regulates cellular functions through its potent transcriptional repressor function. Work presented here provides support for an alternative mechanism of H-NS-based regulation, and adds to our understanding of how bacterial transposition can be regulated.","13 April 2012","Tn5,H-NS,DNA transposition,Transpososome assembly,Host factor","haniford@uwo.ca","David B Haniford."

In bacterial genomes, they play a major role in the comings and goings of mobile genetic elements (MGEs), such as temperate phage genomes, integrated conjugative elements (ICEs) or integron cassettes. TBSSRs are also involved in the segregation of plasmids and chromosomes, the resolution of plasmid dimers and of co-integrates resulting from the replicative transposition of transposons. With the aim of improving the annotation of TBSSR genes in genomic sequences and databases, which so far is far from robust, we built a set of over 1,300 TBSSR protein sequences tagged with their genome of origin. We organized them in families to investigate: i) whether TBSSRs tend to be more conserved within than between classes of MGE types and ii) whether the (sub)families may help in understanding more about the function of TBSSRs associated in tandem or trios on plasmids and chromosomes.,A total of 67% of the TBSSRs in our set are MGE type specific. We define a new class of actinobacterial transposons, related to Tn554, containing one abnormally long TBSSR and one of typical size, and we further characterize numerous TBSSRs trios present in plasmids and chromosomes of α- and β-proteobacteria.,The simple in silico procedure described here, which uses a set of reference TBSSRs from defined MGE types, could contribute to greatly improve the annotation of tyrosine-based site-specific recombinases in plasmid, (pro)phage and other integrated MGE genomes. It also reveals TBSSRs families whose distribution among bacterial taxa suggests they mediate lateral gene transfer.","13 April 2012","Mobile Genetic Element,Catalytic Motif,Integrate Conjugative Element,Replicative Transposition,Plasmid Protein","ariane.toussaint@ulb.ac.be","Ariane Toussaint."
"359","How does selfing affect the dynamics of selfish transposable elements?","Thibaud S Boutin, Arnaud Le Rouzic and Pierre Capy","Many theoretical models predicting the dynamics of transposable elements (TEs) in genomes, populations, and species have already been proposed. However, most of them only focus on populations of sexual diploid individuals, and TE dynamics in populations partly composed by autogamous individuals remains poorly investigated. To estimate the impact of selfing on TE dynamics, the short- and long-term evolution of TEs was simulated in outcrossing populations with various proportions of selfing individuals.,Selfing has a deep impact on TE dynamics: the higher the selfing rate, the lower the probability of invasion. Already known non-equilibrium dynamics (complete loss, domestication, cyclical invasion of TEs) can all be described whatever the mating system. However, their pattern and their respective frequencies greatly depend on the selfing rate. For instance, in cyclical dynamics resulting from interactions between autonomous and non-autonomous copies, cycles are faster when the selfing rate increases. Interestingly, an abrupt change in the mating system from sexuality to complete asexuality leads to the loss of all the elements over a few hundred generations. In general, for intermediate selfing rates, the transposition activity remains maintained.,Our theoretical results evidence that a clear and systematic contrast in TE content according to the mating system is expected, with a smooth transition for intermediate selfing rates. Several parameters impact the TE copy number, and all dynamics described in allogamous populations can be also observed in partly autogamous species. This study thus provides new insights to understand the complex signal from empirical comparison of closely related species with different mating systems.","07 March 2012","Selfing Rate,Transposition Rate,Transposition Activity,Ectopic Recombination,Selfing Population","pierre.capy@legs.cnrs-gif.fr","Pierre Capy."
"360","Copy number variation of ribosomal DNA and Pokey transposons in natural populations of Daphnia","Shannon HC Eagle and Teresa J Crease","Despite their ubiquity and high diversity in eukaryotic genomes, DNA transposons are rarely encountered in ribosomal DNA (rDNA). In contrast, R-elements, a diverse group of non-LTR retrotransposons, specifically target rDNA. Pokey is a DNA transposon that targets a specific rDNA site, but also occurs in many other genomic locations, unlike R-elements. However, unlike most DNA transposons, Pokey has been a stable component of Daphnia genomes for over 100 million years. Here we use qPCR to estimate the number of 18S and 28S ribosomal RNA genes and Pokey elements in rDNA (rPokey), as well as other genomic locations (gPokey) in two species of Daphnia. Our goals are to estimate the correlation between (1) the number of 18S and 28S rRNA genes, (2) the number of 28S genes and rPokey, and (3) the number of rPokey and gPokey. In addition, we ask whether Pokey number and distribution in both genomic compartments are affected by differences in life history between D. pulex and D. pulicaria.,We found differences in 18S and 28S gene number within isolates that are too large to be explained by experimental variation. In general, Pokey number within isolates is modest (< 20), and most are gPokey. There is no correlation between the number of rRNA genes and rPokey, or between rPokey and gPokey. However, we identified three isolates with unusually high numbers of both rPokey and gPokey, which we infer is a consequence of recent transposition. We also detected other rDNA insertions (rInserts) that could be degraded Pokey elements, R- elements or the divergent Pokey B lineage recently detected in the Daphnia genome sequence. Unlike rPokey, rInserts are positively correlated with rRNA genes, suggesting that they are amplified by the same mechanisms that amplify rDNA units even though rPokey is not. Overall, Pokey frequency and distribution are similar in D. pulex and D. pulicaria suggesting that differences in life history have no impact on Pokey.,The possibility that many rDNA units do not contain a copy of both 18S and 28S genes suggests that rDNA is much more complicated than once thought, and warrants further study. In addition, the lack of correlation between rPokey, gPokey and rDNA unit numbers suggests that Pokey transposition rate is generally very low, and that recombination, in combination with natural selection, eliminates rPokey much faster than gPokey. Our results suggest that further research to determine the mechanisms by which Pokey has escaped complete inactivation by its host (the usual fate of DNA transposons), would provide important insights into transposon biology.","05 March 2012","

For both of these uses, a transposon with minimal insertion bias is desired to allow complete coverage with minimal oversampling.,Three transposons, Mu, Tn5, and Tn7, were used to generate insertions in the same set of fosmids containing Candida glabrata genomic DNA. Tn7 demonstrates markedly less insertion bias than either Mu or Tn5, with both Mu and Tn5 biased toward sequences containing guanosine (G) and cytidine (C). This preference of Mu and Tn5 yields less uniform spacing of insertions than for Tn7, in the adenosine (A) and thymidine (T) rich genome of C. glabrata (39% GC).,In light of its more uniform distribution of insertions, Tn7 should be considered for applications in which insertion bias is deleterious.","07 February 2012","Tn7,Mu,Tn5,Mutagenesis,Insertion site,DNA transposon,Mobile element","bcormack@jhmi.edu","Brendan P Cormack."

One factor that influences their evolutionary dynamics is whether their host reproduces through selfing or through outcrossing. According to the recombinational spreading hypothesis, for instance, TEs can spread more easily in outcrossing species through recombination, and should thus be less abundant in selfing species. We here studied the distribution and evolutionary dynamics of TE families in the predominantly selfing plant Arabidopsis thaliana and its close outcrossing relative Arabidopsis lyrata on a genome-wide scale. We characterized differences in TE abundance between them and asked which, if any, existing hypotheses about TE abundances may explain these differences.,We identified 1,819 TE families representing all known classes of TEs in both species, and found three times more copies in the outcrossing A. lyrata than in the predominantly selfing A. thaliana, as well as ten times more TE families unique to A. lyrata. On average, elements in A. lyrata are younger than elements in A. thaliana. In particular, A. thaliana shows a marked decrease in element number that occurred during the most recent 10% of the time interval since A. thaliana split from A. lyrata. This most recent period in the evolution of A. thaliana started approximately 500,000 years ago, assuming a splitting time of 5 million years ago, and coincides with the time at which predominant selfing originated.,Our results indicate that the mating system may be important for determining TE copy number, and that selfing species are likely to have fewer TEs.","07 February 2012","transposable elements,

A figure-of-eight intermediate in Step I, from asymmetric single-strand cleavage and joining reactions, is converted into a double-stranded minicircle whose junction (the abutted left and right ends) is the substrate for symmetrical transesterification attacks on target DNA in Step II, suggesting intrinsically different synaptic complexes (SC) for each step. Transposases of these ISs bind poorly to cognate DNA and comparative biophysical analyses of SC I and SC II have proven elusive. We have prepared a native, soluble, active, GFP-tagged fusion derivative of the IS2 transposase that creates fully formed complexes with single-end and minicircle junction (MCJ) substrates and used these successfully in hydroxyl radical footprinting experiments.,In IS2, Step I reactions are physically and chemically asymmetric; the left imperfect, inverted repeat (IRL), the exclusive recipient end, lacks donor function. In SC I, different protection patterns of the cleavage domains (CDs) of the right imperfect inverted repeat (IRR; extensive in cis) and IRL (selective in trans) at the single active cognate IRR catalytic center (CC) are related to their donor and recipient functions. In SC II, extensive binding of the IRL CD in trans and of the abutted IRR CD in cis at this CC represents the first phase of the complex. An MCJ substrate precleaved at the 3' end of IRR revealed a temporary transition state with the IRL CD disengaged from the protein. We propose that in SC II, sequential 3' cleavages at the bound abutted CDs trigger a conformational change, allowing the IRL CD to complex to its cognate CC, producing the second phase. Corroborating data from enhanced residues and curvature propensity plots suggest that CD to CD interactions in SC I and SC II require IRL to assume a bent structure, to facilitate binding in trans.,Different transpososomes are assembled in each step of the IS2 transposition pathway. Recipient versus donor end functions of the IRL CD in SC I and SC II and the conformational change in SC II that produces the phase needed for symmetrical IRL and IRR donor attacks on target DNA highlight the differences.","26 January 2012","Curvature propensity plot data,extensive sequence-specific binding,figure-of-eight transposition intermediate,hydroxyl radical footprinting,minicircle junction,selective binding,synaptic complex,transpososome","lewis_l@york.cuny.edu","Leslie A Lewis."

Injecting one-cell embryos with plasmid DNA harboring an SB transposon substrate together with mRNA encoding the SB transposase enzyme resulted in non-canonical integration of small-order concatemers of the transposon. Here, we demonstrate that SB transposons stably integrated into the frog genome are effective substrates for remobilization.,Transgenic frogs that express the SB 10 transposase were bred with SB transposon-harboring animals to yield double-transgenic 'hopper' frogs. Remobilization events were observed in the progeny of the hopper frogs and were verified by Southern blot analysis and cloning of the novel integrations sites. Unlike the co-injection method used to generate founder lines, transgenic remobilization resulted in canonical transposition of the SB transposons. The remobilized SB transposons frequently integrated near the site of the donor locus; approximately 80% re-integrated with 3 Mb of the donor locus, a phenomenon known as 'local hopping'.,In this study, we demonstrate that SB transposons integrated into the X. tropicalis genome are effective substrates for excision and re-integration, and that the remobilized transposons are transmitted through the germline.

Its conversion to a double stranded minicircle precedes the second insertional step, where both ends function as donors. In IS2, the left end which lacks donor function in Step I acquires it in Step II. The assembly of two intrinsically different protein-DNA complexes in these F-8 generating elements has been intuitively proposed, but a barrier to testing this hypothesis has been the difficulty of isolating a full length, soluble and active transposase that creates fully formed synaptic complexes in vitro with protein bound to both binding and catalytic domains of the ends. We address here a solution to expressing, purifying and structurally analyzing such a protein.,A soluble and active IS2 transposase derivative with GFP fused to its C-terminus functions as efficiently as the native protein in in vivo transposition assays. In vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assay data show that the partially purified protein prepared under native conditions binds very efficiently to cognate DNA, utilizing both N- and C-terminal residues. As a precursor to biophysical analyses of these complexes, a fluorescence-based random mutagenesis protocol was developed that enabled a structure-function analysis of the protein with good resolution at the secondary structure level. The results extend previous structure-function work on IS3 family transposases, identifying the binding domain as a three helix H + HTH bundle and explaining the function of an atypical leucine zipper-like motif in IS2. In addition gain- and loss-of-function mutations in the catalytic active site define its role in regional and global binding and identify functional signatures that are common to the three dimensional catalytic core motif of the retroviral integrase superfamily.,Intractably insoluble transposases, such as the IS2 transposase, prepared by solubilization protocols are often refractory to whole protein structure-function studies.

This modest degree of nucleotide divergence is not sufficient to explain the extensive phenotypic differences between the two species. It has been hypothesized that the genetic basis of the phenotypic differences lies at the level of gene regulation and is associated with the extensive insertion and deletion (INDEL) variation between the two species. To test the hypothesis that large INDELs (80 to 12,000 bp) may have contributed significantly to differences in gene regulation between the two species, we categorized human-chimpanzee INDEL variation mapping in or around genes and determined whether this variation is significantly correlated with previously determined differences in gene expression.,Extensive, large INDEL variation exists between the human and chimpanzee genomes. This variation is primarily attributable to retrotransposon insertions within the human lineage. There is a significant correlation between differences in gene expression and large human-chimpanzee INDEL variation mapping in genes or in proximity to them.,The results presented herein are consistent with the hypothesis that large INDELs, particularly those associated with retrotransposons, have played a significant role in human-chimpanzee regulatory evolution.","25 October 2011","insertion and deletion,differential gene expression,retrotransposon,noninterspersed sequence,human insertion,short interspersed nuclear element","mcgene@gatech.edu","John F McDonald."

These breakthroughs were accomplished by the adaptation of molecular functions essential for TEs, such as reverse transcription, DNA cutting and ligation or DNA binding. Cryptons represent a unique class of DNA transposons using tyrosine recombinase (YR) to cut and rejoin the recombining DNA molecules. Cryptons were originally identified in fungi and later in the sea anemone, sea urchin and insects.,Herein we report new Cryptons from animals, fungi, oomycetes and diatom, as well as widely conserved genes derived from ancient Crypton domestication events. Phylogenetic analysis based on the YR sequences supports four deep divisions of Crypton elements. We found that the domain of unknown function 3504 (DUF3504) in eukaryotes is derived from Crypton YR. DUF3504 is similar to YR but lacks most of the residues of the catalytic tetrad (R-H-R-Y). Genes containing the DUF3504 domain are potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 1 (KCTD1), KIAA1958, zinc finger MYM type 2 (ZMYM2), ZMYM3, ZMYM4, glutamine-rich protein 1 (QRICH1) and ""without children"" (WOC). The DUF3504 genes are highly conserved and are found in almost all jawed vertebrates. The sequence, domain structure, intron positions and synteny blocks support the view that ZMYM2, ZMYM3, ZMYM4, and possibly QRICH1, were derived from WOC through two rounds of genome duplication in early vertebrate evolution. WOC is observed widely among bilaterians. There could be four independent events of Crypton domestication, and one of them, generating WOC/ZMYM, predated the birth of bilaterian animals. This is the third-oldest domestication event known to date, following the domestication generating telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and Prp8. Many Crypton-derived genes are transcriptional regulators with additional DNA-binding domains, and the acquisition of the DUF3504 domain could have added new regulatory pathways via protein-DNA or protein-protein interactions.,Cryptons have contributed to animal evolution through domestication of their YR sequences.

R2 somatic mosaics were detected encompassing cells from individual tissues as well as tissues from multiple body segments. The somatic insertions had 5' junction sequences characteristic of germline insertions suggesting they represented authentic retrotransposition events.,Body segments are specified early in Drosophila development, thus the detection of the same somatic insertion in cells from multiple tissues suggested that the R2 retrotransposition events had occurred before the blastoderm stage of Drosophila development. R2 activity at this stage, when embryonic nuclei are rapidly dividing in a common cytoplasm, suggests that some retrotransposition events appearing as germline events may correspond to germline mosaicism.","29 September 2011","Mobile Element,Somatic Tissue,Imaginal Disc,Nurse Cell,rDNA Locus","eick@mail.rochester.edu","Thomas H Eickbush."

Herves is a member of the hAT superfamily of class 2 transposons and was isolated from Anopheles gambiae, a medically important mosquito species that is the major vector of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. Herves is transpositionally active and intact copies of it are found in field populations of A gambiae. In this study we report the binding activities of the Herves transposase to the sequences at the ends of the Herves transposon and compare these to other sequences recognized by hAT transposases isolated from other organisms.,We identified the specific DNA-binding sites of the Herves transposase. Active Herves transposase was purified using an Escherichia coli expression system and bound in a site-specific manner to the subterminal and terminal sequences of the left and right ends of the element, respectively, and also interacted with the right but not the left terminal inverted repeat. We identified a common subterminal DNA-binding motif (CG/AATTCAT) that is critical and sufficient for Herves transposase binding.,The Herves transposase binds specifically to a short motif located at both ends of the transposon but shows differential binding with respect to the left and right terminal inverted repeats. Despite similarities in the overall structures of hAT transposases, the regions to which they bind in their respective transposons differ in sequence ensuring the specificity of these enzymes to their respective transposon. The asymmetry with which the Herves terminal inverted repeats are bound by the transposase may indicate that these differ in their interactions with the enzyme.","20 June 2011","Binding Motif,Terminal Inverted Repeat,Specific Competitor,Herves Element,Transposase Binding","peter.atkinson@ucr.edu","Peter W Atkinson."

We propose the TE-Thrust hypothesis to encompass TE-facilitated processes by which genomes self-engineer coding, regulatory, karyotypic or other genetic changes. Although TEs are occasionally harmful to some individuals, genomic dynamism caused by TEs can be very beneficial to lineages. This can result in differential survival and differential fecundity of lineages. Lineages with an abundant and suitable repertoire of TEs have enhanced evolutionary potential and, if all else is equal, tend to be fecund, resulting in species-rich adaptive radiations, and/or they tend to undergo major evolutionary transitions. Many other mechanisms of genomic change are also important in evolution, and whether the evolutionary potential of TE-Thrust is realized is heavily dependent on environmental and ecological factors. The large contribution of TEs to evolutionary innovation is particularly well documented in the primate lineage.

A hitherto unknown proportion of ERV loci are transcribed and thus contribute to the human transcriptome. A small proportion of these loci encode functional proteins. As the role of ERVs in normal and diseased biological processes is not yet established, transcribed ERV loci are of particular interest. As more transcribed ERV loci are likely to be identified in the near future, the development of a systematic nomenclature is important to ensure that all information on each locus can be easily retrieved.,Here we present a revised nomenclature of transcribed human endogenous retroviral loci that sorts loci into groups based on Repbase classifications. Each symbol is of the format ERV + group symbol + unique number. Group symbols are based on a mixture of Repbase designations and well-supported symbols used in the literature. The presented guidelines will allow newly identified loci to be easily incorporated into the scheme.,The naming system will be employed by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee for naming transcribed human ERV loci. We hope that the system will contribute to clarifying a certain aspect of a sometimes confusing nomenclature for human endogenous retroviruses. The presented system may also be employed for naming transcribed loci of human non-ERV repeat loci.","04 May 2011","European Molecular Biology Laboratory,Human Genome Organisation,Nomenclature Scheme,Primer Binding Site Sequence,Partial Open Reading Frame","rseal@ebi.ac.uk","Ruth L Seal."

The SOS response is a regulatory network under control of the repressor protein LexA targeted at addressing DNA damage, thus promoting genetic variation in times of stress. We recently reported a direct link between the SOS response and the expression of integron integrases in Vibrio cholerae and a plasmid-borne class 1 mobile integron. SOS regulation enhances cassette swapping and capture in stressful conditions, while freezing the integron in steady environments. We conducted a systematic study of available integron integrase promoter sequences to analyze the extent of this relationship across the Bacteria domain.,Our results showed that LexA controls the expression of a large fraction of integron integrases by binding to Escherichia coli-like LexA binding sites. In addition, the results provide experimental validation of LexA control of the integrase gene for another Vibrio chromosomal integron and for a multiresistance plasmid harboring two integrons. There was a significant correlation between lack of LexA control and predicted inactivation of integrase genes, even though experimental evidence also indicates that LexA regulation may be lost to enhance expression of integron cassettes.,Ancestral-state reconstruction on an integron integrase phylogeny led us to conclude that the ancestral integron was already regulated by LexA. The data also indicated that SOS regulation has been actively preserved in mobile integrons and large chromosomal integrons, suggesting that unregulated integrase activity is selected against. Nonetheless, additional adaptations have probably arisen to cope with unregulated integrase activity. Identifying them may be fundamental in deciphering the uneven distribution of integrons in the Bacteria domain.","30 April 2011","Integrase Gene,LexA Protein,IntI Sequence,LexA Binding,lexA Gene","mazel@pasteur.fr,erill@umbc.edu","Didier Mazel or Ivan Erill."

The Sleeping Beauty (SB) system has become one of the most favored methods, because of its efficiency and its random integration profile. Copy-number determination of the delivered transgene is a crucial task, but a universal method for measuring this is lacking. In this paper, we show that a real-time quantitative PCR-based, transgene-independent (qPCR-TI) method is able to determine SB transposon copy numbers regardless of the genetic cargo.,We designed a specific PCR assay to amplify the left inverted repeat-direct repeat region of SB, and used it together with the single-copy control gene RPPH1 and a reference genomic DNA of known copy number. The qPCR-TI method allowed rapid and accurate determination of SB transposon copy numbers in various cell types, including human embryonic stem cells. We also found that this sensitive, rapid, highly reproducible and non-radioactive method is just as accurate and reliable as the widely used blotting techniques or the transposon display method. Because the assay is specific for the inverted repeat region of the transposon, it could be used in any system where the SB transposon is the genetic vehicle.,We have developed a transgene-independent method to determine copy numbers of transgenes delivered by the SB transposon system. The technique is based on a quantitative real-time PCR detection method, offering a sensitive, non-radioactive, rapid and accurate approach, which has a potential to be used for gene therapy.","03 March 2011","Green Fluorescent Protein,Sleep Beauty,gDNA Sample,Relative Standard Curve Method,High Speed Cell Sorter","orbant@biomembrane.hu","Tamás I Orbán."

Despite their potential importance for centromere evolution and function, they have remained poorly characterized. In this work, we aimed to carry out a comprehensive survey of CRM clade elements with an emphasis on their diversity, structure, chromosomal distribution and transcriptional activity.,We have surveyed a set of 190 CRM elements belonging to 81 different retrotransposon families, derived from 33 host species and falling into 12 plant families. The sequences at the C-terminus of their integrases were unexpectedly heterogeneous, despite the understanding that they are responsible for targeting to the centromere. This variation allowed the division of the CRM clade into the three groups A, B and C, and the members of each differed considerably with respect to their chromosomal distribution. The differences in chromosomal distribution coincided with variation in the integrase C-terminus sequences possessing a putative targeting domain (PTD). A majority of the group A elements possess the CR motif and are concentrated in the centromeric region, while members of group C have the type II chromodomain and are dispersed throughout the genome. Although representatives of the group B lack a PTD of any type, they appeared to be localized preferentially in the centromeres of tested species. All tested elements were found to be transcriptionally active.,Comprehensive analysis of the CRM clade elements showed that genuinely centromeric retrotransposons represent only a fraction of the CRM clade (group A). These centromeric retrotransposons represent an active component of centromeres of a wide range of angiosperm species, implying that they play an important role in plant centromere evolution. In addition, their transcriptional activity is consistent with the notion that the transcription of centromeric retrotransposons has a role in normal centromere function.","03 March 2011","Long Terminal Repeat,Bacterial Artificial Chromosome Clone,Centromeric Region,Centromere Function,Centromeric Localization","neumann@umbr.cas.cz","Pavel Neumann."
"376","Effect of attC structure on cassette excision by integron integrases","André Larouche and Paul H Roy","Integrons are genetic elements able to integrate and disseminate genes as cassettes by a site-specific recombination mechanism. These elements contain a gene coding for an integrase that carries out recombination by interacting with two different target sites; the attI site in cis with the integrase and the palindromic attC site of a gene cassette. Integron integrases (IntIs) bind specifically to the bottom strand of attC sites. The extrahelical bases resulting from folding of attC bottom strands are important for the recognition by integrases. These enzymes are directly involved in the accumulation and formation of new cassette arrangements in the variable region of integrons. Thus, it is important to better understand interactions between IntIs and their substrates.,We compared the ability of five IntIs to carry out excision of several cassettes flanked by different attC sites. The results showed that for most cassettes, IntI1 was the most active integrase. However, IntI2*179E and SonIntIA could easily excise cassettes containing the attCdfrA1
                   site located upstream, whereas IntI1 and IntI3 had only a weak excision activity for these cassettes. Analysis of the secondary structure adopted by the bottom strand of attCdfrA1
                   has shown that the identity of the extrahelical bases and the distance between them (A-N7-8-C) differ from those of attC s contained in the cassettes most easily excisable by IntI1 (T-N6-G). We used the attCdfrA1
                   site upstream of the sat2 gene cassette as a template and varied the identity and spacing between the extrahelical bases in order to determine how these modifications influence the ability of IntI1, IntI2*179E, IntI3 and SonIntIA to excise cassettes. Our results show that IntI1 is more efficient in cassette excision using T-N6-G or T-N6-C attC s while IntI3 recognizes only a limited range of attC s. IntI2*179E and SonIntIA are more tolerant of changes to the identity and spacing of extrahelical bases.,This study provides new insights into the factors that influence the efficiency of cassette excision by integron integrases. It also suggests that IntI2 and SonIntIA have an evolutionary path that is different from IntI1 and IntI3, in their ability to recognize and excise cassettes.","18 February 2011","Bottom Strand,Resistance Gene Cassette,Tyrosine Recombinases,attC Site,Excision Activity","paul.roy@crchul.ulaval.ca","Paul H Roy."

Native L1 elements are inefficiently expressed because of a transcription elongation defect thought to be caused by high adenosine content in L1 sequences. Previously, we constructed a highly active synthetic mouse L1 element (ORFeus-Mm), partially by reducing the nucleotide composition bias. As a result, the transcript abundance of ORFeus-Mm was greatly increased, and its retrotransposition frequency was > 200-fold higher than its native counterpart. In this paper, we report a synthetic human L1 element (ORFeus-Hs) synthesized using a similar strategy. The adenosine content of the L1 open reading frames (ORFs) was reduced from 40% to 27% by changing 25% of the bases in the ORFs, without altering the amino acid sequence. By studying a series of native/synthetic chimeric elements, we observed increased levels of full-length L1 RNA and ORF1 protein and retrotransposition frequency, mostly proportional to increased fraction of synthetic sequence. Overall, the fully synthetic ORFeus-Hs has > 40-fold more RNA but is at most only ~threefold more active than its native counterpart (L1RP); however, its absolute retrotransposition activity is similar to ORFeus-Mm. Owing to the elevated expression of the L1 RNA/protein and its high retrotransposition ability, ORFeus-Hs and its chimeric derivatives will be useful tools for mechanistic L1 studies and mammalian genome manipulation.","14 February 2011","Codon Optimization,Saline Sodium Citrate,ORF1 Protein,Synthetic Sequence,Puromycin Selection","jboeke@jhmi.edu","Jef D Boeke."

The plasmids have a unique clothespin structure that includes a 5'-linked protein and telomere-like terminal repeats, with pFOXC2 and pFOXC3 having iterative copies of a 5 bp sequence. The plasmids contain a single large open reading frame (ORF) encoding an active reverse transcriptase (RT). The pFOXC-RT is associated with the plasmid transcript in a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex and can synthesize full-length (-) strand cDNA products. In reactions containing partially purified RT preparations with exogenous RNAs, the pFOXC3-RT has been shown to initiate cDNA synthesis by use of snapped-back RNAs, as well as loosely associated DNA primers.,The complete sequence of the distantly related pFOXC1 plasmid was determined and found to terminate in 3-5 copies of a 3 bp sequence. Unexpectedly, the majority of (-) strand cDNA molecules produced from endogenous pFOXC1 transcripts were attached to protein. In vitro experiments using partially purified pFOXC3-RT preparations having a single radiolabeled deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) generated a nucleotide-labeled protein that migrated at the size of the pFOXC-RT. The nucleotide preference of deoxynucleotidylation differed between pFOXC3 and pFOXC1 and showed complementarity to the respective 3' terminal repeats. In reactions that include exogenous RNA templates corresponding to the 3' end of pFOXC1, a protein-linked cDNA product was generated following deoxynucleotidylation, suggesting that reverse transcription initiates with a protein primer.,The finding that reverse transcription is protein primed suggests the pFOXC retroplasmids may have an evolutionary relationship with hepadnaviruses, the only other retroelement family known to initiate reverse transcription via a protein primer. Moreover, the similarity to protein-primed linear DNA elements supports models in which the terminal repeats are generated and maintained by a DNA slideback mechanism. The ability of the pFOXC-RT to utilize RNA, DNA and protein primers is unique among polymerases and suggests that the pFOXC plasmids may be evolutionary precursors of a broad range of retroelements, including hepadnaviruses, non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons and telomerase.","21 January 2011","Reverse Transcription Reaction,Plasmid Transcript,cDNA Product,Micrococcal Nuclease,Retroelement Family","kennellj@slu.edu","John C Kennell."

The mobility of class II transposable elements (DNA transposons) can be controlled by conditionally providing the transposase component of the transposition reaction. Thus, a DNA of interest (be it a fluorescent marker, a small hairpin (sh)RNA expression cassette, a mutagenic gene trap or a therapeutic gene construct) cloned between the inverted repeat sequences of a transposon-based vector can be used for stable genomic insertion in a regulated and highly efficient manner. This methodological paradigm opened up a number of avenues for genome manipulations in vertebrates, including transgenesis for the generation of transgenic cells in tissue culture, the production of germline transgenic animals for basic and applied research, forward genetic screens for functional gene annotation in model species, and therapy of genetic disorders in humans. Sleeping Beauty (SB) was the first transposon shown to be capable of gene transfer in vertebrate cells, and recent results confirm that SB supports a full spectrum of genetic engineering including transgenesis, insertional mutagenesis, and therapeutic somatic gene transfer both ex vivo and in vivo. The first clinical application of the SB system will help to validate both the safety and efficacy of this approach. In this review, we describe the major transposon systems currently available (with special emphasis on SB), discuss the various parameters and considerations pertinent to their experimental use, and highlight the state of the art in transposon technology in diverse genetic applications.","07 December 2010","Insertional Mutagenesis,Sleep Beauty,Transpositional Activity,Efficient Transposition,Sleep Beauty Transposase","zivics@mdc-berlin.de","Zoltán Ivics."

Concurrently, several better understood transposon systems have been exploited as efficient tools in molecular biology and genomics applications. Characterization of new mobile elements and improvement of the existing transposition technology platforms warrant easy-to-use assays for the quantitative analysis of DNA transposition.,Here we developed a universal in vivo platform for the analysis of transposition frequency with class II mobile elements, i.e., DNA transposons. For each particular transposon system, cloning of the transposon ends and the cognate transposase gene, in three consecutive steps, generates a multifunctional plasmid, which drives inducible expression of the transposase gene and includes a mobilisable lacZ-containing reporter transposon. The assay scores transposition events as blue microcolonies, papillae, growing within otherwise whitish Escherichia coli colonies on indicator plates. We developed the assay using phage Mu transposition as a test model and validated the platform using various MuA transposase mutants. For further validation and to illustrate universality, we introduced IS903 transposition system components into the assay. The developed assay is adjustable to a desired level of initial transposition via the control of a plasmid-borne E. coli arabinose promoter. In practice, the transposition frequency is modulated by varying the concentration of arabinose or glucose in the growth medium. We show that variable levels of transpositional activity can be analysed, thus enabling straightforward screens for hyper- or hypoactive transposase mutants, regardless of the original wild-type activity level.,The established universal papillation assay platform should be widely applicable to a variety of mobile elements. It can be used for mechanistic studies to dissect transposition and provides a means to screen or scrutinise transposase mutants and genes encoding host factors. In succession, improved versions of transposition systems should yield better tools for molecular biology and offer versatile genome modification vehicles for many types of studies, including gene therapy and stem cell research.","26 November 2010","Transposition Event,Transposase Gene,Transposition Frequency,Transpositional Activity,PBAD Promoter","harri.savilahti@utu.fi","Harri Savilahti."
"381","Regulators of ribonucleotide reductase inhibit Ty1 mobility in saccharomyces cerevisiae","John P O'Donnell, Marie Gehman and Jill B Keeney","Ty1 is a long terminal repeat retrotransposon of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with a replication cycle similar to retrovirus replication. Structurally, Ty1 contains long terminal repeat (LTR) regions flanking the gag and pol genes that encode for the proteins that enable Ty1 mobility. Reverse transcriptase produces Ty1 complementary (c)DNA that can either be integrated back into the genome by integrase or recombined into the yeast genome through homologous recombination. The frequency of Ty1 mobility is temperature sensitive, with optimum activity occurring at 24-26°C.,In this study, we identified two host genes that when deleted allow for high temperature Ty1 mobility: RFX1 and SML1. The protein products of these genes are both negative regulators of the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase, a key enzyme in regulating deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) levels in the cell. Processing of Ty1 proteins is defective at high temperature, and processing is not improved in either rfx1 or sml1 deletion strains. Ty1 mobility at high temperature is mediated by homologous recombination of Ty1 cDNA to Ty1 elements within the yeast genome. We quantified cDNA levels in wild type, rfx1 and sml1 deletion background strains at different temperatures. Southern blot analysis demonstrated that cDNA levels were not markedly different between the wild type and mutant strains as temperatures increased, indicating that the increased Ty1 mobility is not a result of increased cDNA synthesis in the mutant strains. Homologous recombination efficiency was increased in both rfx1 and sml1 deletion strains at high temperatures; the rfx1 deletion strain also had heightened homologous recombination efficiency at permissive temperatures. In the presence of the dNTP reducing agent hydroxyurea at permissive temperatures, Ty1 mobility was stimulated in the wild type and sml1 deletion strains but not in the rfx1 deletion strain. Mobility frequency was greatly reduced in all strains at high temperature. Deletion of the S-phase checkpoint pathway Dun1 kinase, which inactivates Sml1 and Rfx1, reduced Ty1 mobility at a range of temperatures.,Levels of cellular dNTPs, as regulated by components of the S-phase checkpoint pathway, are a limiting factor in homologous recombination-mediated Ty1 mobility.","22 November 2010","Long Terminal Repeat,Deletion Strain,Permissive Temperature,cDNA Level,dNTP Pool","keeney@juniata.edu","Jill B Keeney."
"382","Feedback inhibition of L1 and alu retrotransposition through altered double strand break repair kinetics","Nicholas A Wallace, Victoria P Belancio, Zach Faber and Prescott Deininger","Cells adapt to various chronic toxic exposures in a multitude of ways to minimize further damage and maximize their growth potential. Expression of L1 elements in the human genome can be greatly deleterious to cells, generating numerous double strand breaks (DSBs). Cells have been reported to respond to chronic DSBs by altering the repair of these breaks, including increasing the rate of homology independent DSB repair. Retrotransposition is strongly affected by proteins involved in DSB repair. Therefore, L1 expression has the potential to be a source of chronic DSBs and thus bring about the changes in cellular environment that could ultimately restrict its own retrotransposition.,We demonstrate that constitutive L1 expression leads to quicker DSB repair and decreases in the retrotransposition potential of L1 and other retrotransposons dependent on L1 expression for their mobility. This cellular adaptation results in reduced sensitivity to L1 induced toxicity. These effects can be induced by constitutive expression of the functional L1 ORF2 alone, but not by the constitutive expression of an L1 open reading frame 2 with mutations to its endonuclease and reverse transcriptase domains. This adaptation correlates with the relative activity of the L1 introduced into the cells.,The increased number of DSBs resulting from constitutive expression of L1 results in a more rapid rate of repair. The cellular response to this L1 expression also results in attenuation of retrotransposition and reduced sensitivity of the cells to negative consequences of L1 ORF2 expression. The influence does not appear to be through RNA interference. We believe that the increased rate of DSB repair is the most likely cause of the attenuation of retrotransposition. These alterations act as a fail safe mechanism that allows cells to escape the toxicity associated with the unchecked L1 expression. This gives cells that overexpress L1, such as tumor cells, the ability to survive the high levels of expression. However, the increased rate of break repair may come at the cost of accuracy of repair of the lesion, resulting in increased genomic instability.","27 October 2010","Colony Formation Assay,Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutate,53BP1 Focus,ORF2 mRNA,Strand Specific Probe","pdeinin@tulane.edu","Prescott Deininger."

In vertebrates and yeast, retrotransposons and retroviruses are routinely altered to carry additional genes that are copied into complementary (c)DNA through reverse transcription. Integration of cDNA results in gene delivery; recombination of cDNA with homologous chromosomal sequences can create targeted gene modifications. Plant retrotransposon-based vectors, therefore, may provide new opportunities for plant genome engineering.,A retrotransposon vector system was developed for gene delivery in plants based on the Tnt1 element from Nicotiana tabacum. Mini-Tnt1 transfer vectors were constructed that lack coding sequences yet retain the 5' and 3' long terminal repeats (LTRs) and adjacent cis sequences required for reverse transcription. The internal coding region of Tnt1 was replaced with a neomycin phosphotransferase gene to monitor replication by reverse transcription. Two different mini-Tnt1 s were developed: one with the native 5' LTR and the other with a chimeric 5' LTR that had the first 233 bp replaced by the CaMV 35 S promoter. After transfer into tobacco protoplasts, both vectors undergo retrotransposition using GAG and POL proteins provided in trans by endogenous Tnt1 elements. The transposition frequencies of mini-Tnt1 vectors are comparable with native Tnt1 elements, and like the native elements, insertion sites are within or near coding sequences. In this paper, we provide evidence that template switching occurs during mini-Tnt1 reverse transcription, indicating that multiple copies of Tnt1 mRNA are packaged into virus-like particles.,Our data demonstrate that mini-Tnt1 vectors can replicate efficiently in tobacco cells using GAG and POL proteins provided in trans by native Tnt1 elements. This suggests that helper Tnt1 constructs can be developed to enable a Tnt1-based two-component vector system that could be used in other plant species. Such a vector system may prove useful for gene delivery or the production of cDNA that can serve as a donor molecule for gene modification through homologous recombination.","02 August 2010","Homologous Recombination,Long Terminal Repeat,Primer Binding Site,Protoplast Isolation,Intron Loss","voytas@umn.edu","Daniel F Voytas."

TnsD is one of four transposon-encoded polypeptides (TnsABC+D) required for site-specific insertion of Tn7 into attTn7, and is the target site-selector that binds to a highly conserved sequence in the end of the glmS protein coding region. In this study, we identified important nucleotides within this region that are crucial for TnsD-attTn7 interaction. We also probed the regions of TnsD that interact with attTn7 and found that there are important DNA-binding determinants throughout the entire length of the protein, including an amino-terminal CCCH zinc-finger motif. A key role of TnsD is to recruit the non-sequence specific DNA-binding protein TnsC to attTn7; TnsC also interacts with and controls both the TnsA and TnsB subunits of the Tn7 transposase. TnsC stimulates the binding of TnsD to attTn7 in vivo, and TnsCD and TnsD can also interact in the absence of DNA and localize their interaction domains to the N-terminal region of each protein.","23 July 2010","Attachment Site,Transposition Frequency,Transposition Assay,Chitin Bead,CCCH Motif","ncraig@jhmi.edu","Nancy L Craig."

The structures of L1 copies and trans-mobilized retrocopies are variable and can be classified into three categories: full-length; 5'-truncated; and 5'-inverted insertions. These structures may be generated by different 5' integration mechanisms.,In this study, a method to correctly characterize insertions with short target site duplications (TSDs) is developed and extranucleotides, TSDs and microhomologies (MHs) at junctions were analysed for the three types of insertions. Only 5'-truncated L1 insertions were found to be associated with short TSDs. Both full-length and 5'-truncated retrotransposed sequences in trans, including Alu, SVA and mRNA retrocopies and also full-length and 5'-inverted L1, were not associated with short TSDs, indicating the difference of 5' attachment between retrotransposition in cis and retrotransposition in trans. Target sequence analysis suggested that short TSDs were generated in an L1 endonuclease-dependent manner. The MHs were longer for 5'-inverted L1 than for 5'-truncated L1, indicating less dependence on annealing in 5'-truncated L1 insertions.,The results suggest that insertions flanked by short TSDs occur more often coupled with the insertion of 5'-truncated L1 than with those of other types of insertions in vivo.

Assembly of a bona fide protein-DNA complex, the transpososome, within which transposition is catalysed, is a crucial checkpoint in this regulation. In the case of IS911, a member of the large IS3 bacterial insertion sequence family, the transpososome (synaptic complex A; SCA) is composed of the right and left inverted repeated DNA sequences (IRR and IRL) bridged by the transposase, OrfAB (the IS911-encoded enzyme that catalyses transposition). To characterise further this important protein-DNA complex in vitro, we used different tagged and/or truncated transposase forms and analysed their interaction with IS911 ends using gel electrophoresis. Our results allow us to propose a model in which SCA is assembled with a dimeric form of the transposase. Furthermore, we present atomic force microscopy results showing that the terminal inverted repeat sequences are probably assembled in a parallel configuration within the SCA.

The N-terminal subdomain (NTD) of the capsid was able to interact with itself and with the C-terminal subdomain (CTD) of the capsid, but interacted less well with intact Gag3. Mutations previously shown to block particle assembly disrupted Gag3 interactions more than subdomain interactions.,The findings that the NTD interacts with itself and with the CTD are consistent with previous modeling and a role similar to that of the capsid in retrovirus particle structure. These results are consistent with a model in which the Gag3-Gag3 interactions that initiate assembly differ from the subdomain interactions that potentially underlie particle stability.","05 May 2010","Homotypical Interaction,Heterotypical Interaction,Major Homology Region,Constitutive ADH1 Promoter,Alpha Helical Bundle","sbsandme@uci.edu","Suzanne Sandmeyer."
"391","Creation of a novel telomere-cutting endonuclease based on the EN domain of telomere-specific non-long terminal repeat retrotransposon, TRAS1","Kazutoshi Yoshitake, Hideyuki Aoyagi and Haruhiko Fujiwara","The ends of chromosomes, termed telomeres consist of repetitive DNA. The telomeric sequences shorten with cell division and, when telomeres are critically abbreviated, cells stop proliferating. However, in cancer cells, by the expression of telomerase which elongates telomeres, the cells can continue proliferating. Many approaches for telomere shortening have been pursued in the past, but to our knowledge, cutting telomeres in vivo has not so far been demonstrated. In addition, there is lack of information on the cellular effects of telomere shortening in human cells.,Here, we created novel chimeric endonucleases to cut telomeres by fusing the endonuclease domain (TRAS1EN) of the silkworm's telomere specific non-long terminal repeat retrotransposon TRAS1 to the human telomere-binding protein, TRF1. An in vitro assay demonstrated that the TRAS1EN-TRF1 chimeric endonucleases (T-EN and EN-T) cut the human (TTAGGG)n repeats specifically. The concentration of TRAS1EN-TRF1 chimeric endonucleases necessary for the cleavage of (TTAGGG)n repeats was about 40-fold lower than that of TRAS1EN alone. When TRAS1EN-TRF1 endonucleases were introduced into human U2OS cancer cells using adenovirus vectors, the enzymes localized at telomeres of nuclei, cleaved and shortened the telomeric DNA by double-strand breaks. When human U2OS and HFL-1 fibroblast cells were infected with EN-T recombinant adenovirus, their cellular proliferation was suppressed for about 2 weeks after infection. In contrast, the TRAS1EN mutant (H258A) chimeric endonuclease fused with TRF1 (ENmut-T) did not show the suppression effect. The EN-T recombinant adenovirus induced telomere shortening in U2OS cells, activated the p53-dependent pathway and caused the senescence associated cellular responses, while the ENmut-T construct did not show such effects.,A novel TRAS1EN-TRF1 chimeric endonuclease (EN-T) cuts the human telomeric repeats (TTAGGG)n specifically in vitro and in vivo. Thus, the chimeric endonuclease which is expressed from an adenoviral vector can suppress cell proliferation of cancer cells.","01 April 2010","Telomere Length,Telomeric Repeat,U2OS Cell,Chimeric Enzyme,Endonuclease Domain","haruh@k.u-tokyo.ac.jp","Haruhiko Fujiwara."
"392","A subtelomeric non-LTR retrotransposon Hebe in the bdelloid rotifer Adineta vaga is subject to inactivation by deletions but not 5' truncations","Eugene A Gladyshev and Irina R Arkhipova","Rotifers of the class Bdelloidea are microscopic freshwater invertebrates best known for: their capacity for anhydrobiosis; the lack of males and meiosis; and for the ability to capture genes from other non-metazoan species. Although genetic exchange between these animals might take place by non-canonical means, the overall lack of meiosis and syngamy should greatly impair the ability of transposable elements (TEs) to spread in bdelloid populations. Previous studies demonstrated that bdelloid chromosome ends, in contrast to gene-rich regions, harbour various kinds of TEs, including specialized telomere-associated retroelements, as well as DNA TEs and retrovirus-like retrotransposons which are prone to horizontal transmission. Vertically-transmitted retrotransposons have not previously been reported in bdelloids and their identification and studies of the patterns of their distribution and evolution could help in the understanding of the high degree of TE compartmentalization within bdelloid genomes.,We identified and characterized a non-long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon residing primarily in subtelomeric regions of the genome in the bdelloid rotifer Adineta vaga. Contrary to the currently prevailing views on the mode of proliferation of non-LTR retrotransposons, which results in frequent formation of 5'-truncated ('dead-on-arrival') copies due to the premature disengagement of the element-encoded reverse transcriptase from its template, this non-LTR element, Hebe, is represented only by non-5'-truncated copies. Most of these copies, however, were subject to internal deletions associated with microhomologies, a hallmark of non-homologous end-joining events.,The non-LTR retrotransposon Hebe from the bdelloid rotifer A. vaga was found to undergo frequent microhomology-associated deletions, rather than 5'-terminal truncations characteristic of this class of retrotransposons, and to exhibit preference for telomeric localization. These findings represent the first example of a vertically transmitted putatively deleterious TE in bdelloids, and may indicate the involvement of microhomology-mediated non-homologous end-joining in desiccation-induced double-strand break repair at the genome periphery.","01 April 2010","Subtelomeric Region,Fosmid Library,Reverse Transcriptase Domain,Transposable Element Insertion,Bdelloid Rotifer","iarkhipova@mbl.edu","Irina R Arkhipova."
"393","Extrachromosomal circles of satellite repeats and 5S ribosomal DNA in human cells","Sarit Cohen, Neta Agmon, Olga Sobol and Daniel Segal","Extrachomosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) is ubiquitous in eukaryotic organisms and was detected in every organism tested, including in humans. A two-dimensional gel electrophoresis facilitates the detection of eccDNA in preparations of genomic DNA. Using this technique we have previously demonstrated that most of eccDNA consists of exact multiples of chromosomal tandemly repeated DNA, including both coding genes and satellite DNA.,Here we report the occurrence of eccDNA in every tested human cell line. It has heterogeneous mass ranging from less than 2 kb to over 20 kb. We describe eccDNA homologous to human alpha satellite and the Sst I mega satellite. Moreover, we show, for the first time, circular multimers of the human 5S ribosomal DNA (rDNA), similar to previous findings in Drosophila and plants. We further demonstrate structures that correspond to intermediates of rolling circle replication, which emerge from the circular multimers of 5S rDNA and Sst I satellite.,These findings, and previous reports, support the general notion that every chromosomal tandem repeat is prone to generate eccDNA in eukryoric organisms including humans. They suggest the possible involvement of eccDNA in the length variability observed in arrays of tandem repeats. The implications of eccDNA on genome biology may include mechanisms of centromere evolution, concerted evolution and homogenization of tandem repeats and genomic plasticity.","08 March 2010","Tandem Repeat,Tandem Array,Alpha Satellite,Circular Molecule,Rolling Circle Replication","scohen@post.tau.ac.il","Sarit Cohen."

There is a wide degree of divergence among different elements, suggesting that these sequences are ancient in origin. Here we report the results of several lines of investigation into the genomic organization and evolutionary history of this element family.,We present a classification scheme for Sadhu elements in A. thaliana, describing derivative elements related to the full-length elements we reported previously. We characterized Sadhu5 elements in a set of A. thaliana strains in order to trace the history of radiation in this subfamily. Sequences surrounding the target sites of different Sadhu insertions are consistent with mobilization by LINE retroelements. Finally, we identified Sadhu elements grouping into distinct subfamilies in two related species, Arabidopsis arenosa and Arabidopsis lyrata.,Our analyses suggest that the Sadhu retroelement family has undergone target primed reverse transcription-driven retrotransposition during the divergence of different A. thaliana strains. In addition, Sadhu elements can be found at moderate copy number in three distinct Arabidopsis species, indicating that the evolutionary history of these sequences can be traced back at least several millions of years.","01 March 2010","Joint Genome Institute,Target Site Duplication,Amplify Polymerase Chain Reaction Product,Partial Element,Arabidopsis Species","ejr77@cornell.edu","Eric J Richards."

Analysis of V(D)J recombination activity is typically performed using extrachromosomal recombination substrates that are recovered from transfected cells and selected using bacterial transformation. We have developed a two-colour fluorescence-based system that simplifies detection of both deletion and inversion joining events mediated by RAG proteins.,This system employs two fluorescent reporter genes that differentially mark unrearranged substrates and those that have undergone RAG-mediated deletion or inversion events. The recombination products bear the hallmarks of true V(D)J recombination and activity can be detected using fluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry. Recombination events can be detected without the need for cytotoxic selection of recombination products and the system allows analysis of recombination activity using substrates integrated into the genome.,This system will be useful in the analysis and exploitation of the V(D)J recombination machinery and suggests that similar approaches could be used to replace expression of one gene with another during lymphocyte development.","01 March 2010","Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction,Enhance Green Fluorescent Protein,Deletion Construct,Enhance Green Fluorescent Protein Expression,Recombination Activate Gene","g.p.cook@leeds.ac.uk","Graham P Cook."
"396","Immunity of replicating Mu to self-integration: a novel mechanism employing MuB protein","Jun Ge, Zheng Lou and Rasika M Harshey","We describe a new immunity mechanism that protects actively replicating/transposing Mu from self-integration. We show that this mechanism is distinct from the established cis-immunity mechanism, which operates by removal of MuB protein from DNA adjacent to Mu ends. MuB normally promotes integration into DNA to which it is bound, hence its removal prevents use of this DNA as target. Contrary to what might be expected from a cis-immunity mechanism, strong binding of MuB was observed throughout the Mu genome. We also show that the cis-immunity mechanism is apparently functional outside Mu ends, but that the level of protection offered by this mechanism is insufficient to explain the protection seen inside Mu. Thus, both strong binding of MuB inside and poor immunity outside Mu testify to a mechanism of immunity distinct from cis-immunity, which we call 'Mu genome immunity'. MuB has the potential to coat the Mu genome and prevent auto-integration as previously observed in vitro on synthetic A/T-only DNA, where strong MuB binding occluded the entire bound region from Mu insertions. The existence of two rival immunity mechanisms within and outside the Mu genome, both employing MuB, suggests that the replicating Mu genome must be segregated into an independent chromosomal domain. We propose a model for how formation of a 'Mu domain' may be aided by specific Mu sequences and nucleoid-associated proteins, promoting polymerization of MuB on the genome to form a barrier against self-integration.","01 February 2010","Strand Transfer,Fragment Length Analysis,Moloney Leukemia Virus,Strand Transfer Reaction,Cold Gene","rasika@uts.cc.utexas.edu","Rasika M Harshey."

These elements comprise as much as 17% of primate genomes with the majority of insertions occurring via target primed reverse transcription (TPRT). Twin priming, a variant of TPRT, can result in unusual DNA sequence architecture. These insertions appear to be inverted, truncated L1s flanked by target site duplications.,We report on loci with sequence architecture consistent with variants of the twin priming mechanism and introduce dual priming, a mechanism that could generate similar sequence characteristics. These insertions take the form of truncated L1s with hallmarks of classical TPRT insertions but having a poly(T) simple repeat at the 5' end of the insertion. We identified loci using computational analyses of the human, chimpanzee, orangutan, rhesus macaque and marmoset genomes. Insertion site characteristics for all putative loci were experimentally verified.,The 39 loci that passed our computational and experimental screens probably represent inversion-deletion events which resulted in a 5' inverted poly(A) tail. Based on our observations of these loci and their local sequence properties, we conclude that they most probably represent twin priming events with unusually short non-inverted portions. We postulate that dual priming could, theoretically, produce the same patterns. The resulting homopolymeric stretches associated with these insertion events may promote genomic instability and create potential target sites for future retrotransposition events.","01 February 2010","Primate Genome,Bottom Strand,Twin Priming,Sequence Architecture,Homopolymeric Stretch","mbatzer@lsu.edu","Mark A Batzer."

Transposable elements (TEs) may be among the most important internal sources for intraspecific variability. Thus, we aimed to explore the temporal dynamics of several TEs in individual genotypes from a small, marginal population of Aegilops speltoides. A diploid cross-pollinated grass species, it is a wild relative of the various wheat species known for their large genome sizes contributed by an extraordinary number of TEs, particularly long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons. The population is characterized by high heteromorphy and possesses a wide spectrum of chromosomal abnormalities including supernumerary chromosomes, heterozygosity for translocations, and variability in the chromosomal position or number of 45S and 5S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sites. We propose that variability on the morphological and chromosomal levels may be linked to variability at the molecular level and particularly in TE proliferation.,Significant temporal fluctuation in the copy number of TEs was detected when processes that take place in small, marginal populations were simulated. It is known that under critical external conditions, outcrossing plants very often transit to self-pollination. Thus, three morphologically different genotypes with chromosomal aberrations were taken from a wild population of Ae. speltoides, and the dynamics of the TE complex traced through three rounds of selfing. It was discovered that: (i) various families of TEs vary tremendously in copy number between individuals from the same population and the selfed progenies; (ii) the fluctuations in copy number are TE-family specific; (iii) there is a great difference in TE copy number expansion or contraction between gametophytes and sporophytes; and (iv) a small percentage of TEs that increase in copy number can actually insert at novel locations and could serve as a bona fide mutagen.,We hypothesize that TE dynamics could promote or intensify morphological and karyotypical changes, some of which may be potentially important for the process of microevolution, and allow species with plastic genomes to survive as new forms or even species in times of rapid climatic change.","01 February 2010","Long Terminal Repeat,Male Gamete,Spike Morphology,Heterologous Recombination,Real Copy Number","belyayev@research.haifa.ac.il,alan.schulman@helsinki.fi","Alexander Belyayev or Alan H Schulman."

Mobilization of superfamily members requires two separate element-encoded proteins (ORF1 and TPase). Members of this superfamily also mobilize Tourist-like miniature inverted repeat transposable elements (MITEs), which are the most abundant transposable elements associated with the genes of plants, especially the cereal grasses. The phylogenetic analysis of many plant genomes indicates that MITEs can amplify rapidly from one or a few elements to hundreds or thousands.,The most active DNA transposon identified to date in plants or animals is mPing, a rice Tourist-like MITE that is a deletion derivative of the autonomous Ping element. Ping and the closely related Pong are the only known naturally active PIF/Harbinger elements. Some rice strains accumulate ~40 new mPing insertions per plant per generation. In this study we report the development of a yeast transposition assay as a first step in deciphering the mechanism underlying the amplification of Tourist-MITEs.,The ORF1 and TPase proteins encoded by Ping and Pong have been shown to mobilize mPing in rice and in transgenic Arabidopsis. Initial tests of the native proteins in a yeast assay resulted in very low transposition. Significantly higher activities were obtained by mutation of a putative nuclear export signal (NES) in the TPase that increased the amount of TPase in the nucleus. When introduced into Arabidopsis, the NES mutant protein also catalyzed higher frequencies of mPing excision from the gfp reporter gene. Our yeast assay retains key features of excision and insertion of mPing including precise excision, extended insertion sequence preference, and a requirement for two proteins that can come from either Ping or Pong or both elements.,The yeast transposition assay provides a robust platform for analysis of the mechanism underlying transposition catalyzed by the two proteins of PIF/Harbinger elements. It recapitulates all of the features of excision and reinsertion of mPing as seen in plant systems. Furthermore, a mutation of a putative NES in the TPase increased transposition both in yeast and plants.","01 February 2010","Nuclear Export Signal,ORF1 Protein,Target Site Duplication,Miniature Inverted Repeat Transposable Element,Deletion Derivative","sue@plantbio.uga.edu","Susan R Wessler."

"401","Mobile DNA and evolution in the 21st century","James A Shapiro","Scientific history has had a profound effect on the theories of evolution. At the beginning of the 21st century, molecular cell biology has revealed a dense structure of information-processing networks that use the genome as an interactive read-write (RW) memory system rather than an organism blueprint. Genome sequencing has documented the importance of mobile DNA activities and major genome restructuring events at key junctures in evolution: exon shuffling, changes in cis-regulatory sites, horizontal transfer, cell fusions and whole genome doublings (WGDs). The natural genetic engineering functions that mediate genome restructuring are activated by multiple stimuli, in particular by events similar to those found in the DNA record: microbial infection and interspecific hybridization leading to the formation of allotetraploids. These molecular genetic discoveries, plus a consideration of how mobile DNA rearrangements increase the efficiency of generating functional genomic novelties, make it possible to formulate a 21st century view of interactive evolutionary processes. This view integrates contemporary knowledge of the molecular basis of genetic change, major genome events in evolution, and stimuli that activate DNA restructuring with classical cytogenetic understanding about the role of hybridization in species diversification.","25 January 2010","Cell Fusion,Mobile Element,Horizontal Transfer,Exon Shuffling,Sine Element","jsha@uchicago.edu","James A Shapiro."
"402","Ginger DNA transposons in eukaryotes and their evolutionary relationships with long terminal repeat retrotransposons","Weidong Bao, Vladimir V Kapitonov and Jerzy Jurka","In eukaryotes, long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons such as Copia, BEL and Gypsy integrate their DNA copies into the host genome using a particular type of DDE transposase called integrase (INT). The Gypsy INT-like transposase is also conserved in the Polinton/Maverick self-synthesizing DNA transposons and in the 'cut and paste' DNA transposons known as TDD-4 and TDD-5. Moreover, it is known that INT is similar to bacterial transposases that belong to the IS3, IS481, IS30 and IS630 families. It has been suggested that LTR retrotransposons evolved from a non-LTR retrotransposon fused with a DNA transposon in early eukaryotes. In this paper we analyze a diverse superfamily of eukaryotic cut and paste DNA transposons coding for INT-like transposase and discuss their evolutionary relationship to LTR retrotransposons.,A new diverse eukaryotic superfamily of DNA transposons, named Ginger (for 'Gypsy INteGrasE Related') DNA transposons is defined and analyzed. Analogously to the IS3 and IS481 bacterial transposons, the Ginger termini resemble those of the Gypsy LTR retrotransposons. Currently, Ginger transposons can be divided into two distinct groups named Ginger1 and Ginger2/Tdd. Elements from tshe Ginger1 group are characterized by approximately 40 to 270 base pair (bp) terminal inverted repeats (TIRs), and are flanked by CCGG-specific or CCGT-specific target site duplication (ssTSsD) sequences. The Ginger1-encoded transposases contain an approximate 400 amino acid N-terminal portion sharing high amino acid identity to the entire Gypsy-encoded integrases, including the YPYY motif, zinc finger, DDE domain, and, importantly, the GPY/F motif, a hallmark of Gypsy and endogenous retrovirus (ERV) integrases. Ginger1 transposases also contain additional C-terminal domains: ovarian tumor (OTU)-like protease domain or Ulp1 protease domain. In vertebrate genomes, at least two host genes, which were previously thought to be derived from the Gypsy integrases, apparently have evolved from the Ginger1 transposase genes. We also introduce a second Ginger group, designated Ginger2/Tdd, which includes the previously reported DNA transposon TDD-4.,The Ginger superfamily represents eukaryotic DNA transposons closely related to LTR retrotransposons. Ginger elements provide new insights into the evolution of transposable elements and certain transposable element (TE)-derived genes.","25 January 2010","Long Terminal Repeat,Long Terminal Repeat Retrotransposons,Target Site Duplication,H2C2 Zinc Finger Domain,Ginger1 Group","jurka@girinst.org","Jerzy Jurka."
"403","Epigenetic histone modifications of human transposable elements: genome defense versus exaptation","Ahsan Huda, Leonardo Mariño-Ramírez and I King Jordan","Transposition is disruptive in nature and, thus, it is imperative for host genomes to evolve mechanisms that suppress the activity of transposable elements (TEs). At the same time, transposition also provides diverse sequences that can be exapted by host genomes as functional elements. These notions form the basis of two competing hypotheses pertaining to the role of epigenetic modifications of TEs in eukaryotic genomes: the genome defense hypothesis and the exaptation hypothesis. To date, all available evidence points to the genome defense hypothesis as the best explanation for the biological role of TE epigenetic modifications.,We evaluated several predictions generated by the genome defense hypothesis versus the exaptation hypothesis using recently characterized epigenetic histone modification data for the human genome. To this end, we mapped chromatin immunoprecipitation sequence tags from 38 histone modifications, characterized in CD4+ T cells, to the human genome and calculated their enrichment and depletion in all families of human TEs. We found that several of these families are significantly enriched or depleted for various histone modifications, both active and repressive. The enrichment of human TE families with active histone modifications is consistent with the exaptation hypothesis and stands in contrast to previous analyses that have found mammalian TEs to be exclusively repressively modified. Comparisons between TE families revealed that older families carry more histone modifications than younger ones, another observation consistent with the exaptation hypothesis. However, data from within family analyses on the relative ages of epigenetically modified elements are consistent with both the genome defense and exaptation hypotheses. Finally, TEs located proximal to genes carry more histone modifications than the ones that are distal to genes, as may be expected if epigenetically modified TEs help to regulate the expression of nearby host genes.,With a few exceptions, most of our findings support the exaptation hypothesis for the role of TE epigenetic modifications when vetted against the genome defense hypothesis. The recruitment of epigenetic modifications may represent an additional mechanism by which TEs can contribute to the regulatory functions of their host genomes.","25 January 2010","Histone Modification,Long Terminal Repeat,Genome Defense,Repressive Histone Modification,Human Genome Reference Sequence","king.jordan@biology.gatech.edu","I King Jordan."
